## API Implementation

This section describes guidelines for implementing Azure SDK client libraries. Please note that some of these guidelines are automatically enforced by code generation tools.

{% include requirement/MUSTNOT id="android-implementation" %} allow implementation code (that is, code that doesn't form part of the public API) to be mistaken as public API. There are two valid arrangements for implementation code, which in order of preference are the following:

1. Implementation classes can be made package-private and placed within the same package as the consuming class.
2. Implementation classes can be placed within a subpackage named `implementation`.

CheckStyle checks ensure that classes within an `implementation` package arenâ€™t exposed through public API, but it is better that the API not be public in the first place, so preferring to have package-private is the better approach where practicable.

### Service Client

#### Async Service Client

{% include requirement/MUSTNOT id="android-async-blocking" %} include blocking calls inside async client library code.

#### Annotations

Include the following annotations on the service client class. For example, this code sample shows a sample class demonstrating the use of these two annotations:

```java
@ServiceClient(builder = ConfigurationAsyncClientBuilder.class, isAsync = true, service = ConfigurationService.class)
public final class ConfigurationAsyncClient {
    @ServiceMethod(returns = ReturnType.COLLECTION)
    public Mono<Response<ConfigurationSetting>> addSetting(String key, String value) {
        ...
    }
}
```

| Annotation | Location | Description |
|:-----------|:---------|:------------|
| `@ServiceClient` | Service Client | Specifies the builder responsible for instantiating the service client, whether the API is asynchronous, and a reference back to the service interface (the interface annotated with `@ServiceInterface`). |
| `@ServiceMethod` | Service Method | Placed on all service client methods that do network operations. |

#### Service Client Builder

##### Annotations

The `@ServiceClientBuilder` annotation should be placed on any class that is responsible for instantiating service clients (that is, instantiating classes annotated with `@ServiceClient`). For example:

```java
@ServiceClientBuilder(serviceClients = {ConfigurationClient.class, ConfigurationAsyncClient.class})
public final class ConfigurationClientBuilder { ... }
```

This builder states that it can build instances of `ConfigurationClient` and `ConfigurationAsyncClient`.

### Supporting Types

#### Model Types

##### Annotations

There are two annotations of note that should be applied on model classes, when applicable:

* The `@Fluent` annotation is applied to all model classes that are expected to provide a fluent API to end users.
* The `@Immutable` annotation is applied to all immutable classes.

## SDK Feature Implementation

### Configuration

When configuring your client library, particular care must be taken to ensure that the consumer of your client library can properly configure the connectivity to your Azure service both globally (along with other client libraries the consumer is using) and specifically with your client library. For Android applications, configuration can be applied in a variety of ways, such as through application preferences or using a `.properties` file, to name a few.

> TODO: Determine a recommended way to pass configuration parameters to Android libraries

### Logging

Client libraries must make use of the robust logging mechanisms in azure core, so that the consumers can adequately diagnose issues with method calls and quickly determine whether the issue is in the consumer code, client library code, or service.

{% include requirement/MUST id="java-logging-clientlogger" %} use the `ClientLogger` API provided within Azure Core as the sole logging API throughout all client libraries. Internally, `ClientLogger` wraps [SLF4J], so all external configuration that is offered through SLF4J is valid.  We encourage you to expose the SLF4J configuration to end users. For more information, see the [SLF4J user manual].

{% include requirement/MUST id="java-logging-new-clientlogger" %} create a new instance of a `ClientLogger` per instance of all relevant classes, except in situations where performance is critical, the instances are short-lived (and therefore the cost of unique loggers is excessive), or in static-only classes (where there is no instantiation of the class allowed). In these cases, it is acceptable to have a shared (or static) logger instance. For example, the code below will create a `ClientLogger` instance for the `ConfigurationAsyncClient`:

```java
public final class ConfigurationAsyncClient {
    private final ClientLogger logger = new ClientLogger(ConfigurationAsyncClient.class);

    // example async call to a service that uses the Project Reactor APIs to log request, success, and error
    // information out to the service logger instance
    public Mono<Response<ConfigurationSetting>> setSetting(ConfigurationSetting setting) {
        return service.setKey(serviceEndpoint, setting.key(), setting.label(), setting, getETagValue(setting.etag()), null)
            .doOnRequest(ignoredValue -> logger.info("Setting ConfigurationSetting - {}", setting))
            .doOnSuccess(response -> logger.info("Set ConfigurationSetting - {}", response.value()))
            .doOnError(error -> logger.warning("Failed to set ConfigurationSetting - {}", setting, error));
    }
}
```

Note that static loggers are shared among all client library instances running in a JVM instance. Static loggers should be used carefully and in short-lived cases only.

{% include requirement/MUST id="java-logging-levels" %} use one of the following log levels when emitting logs: `Verbose` (details), `Informational` (things happened), `Warning` (might be a problem or not), and `Error`.

{% include requirement/MUST id="java-logging-errors" %} use the `Error` logging level for failures that the application is unlikely to recover from (out of memory, etc.).

{% include requirement/MUST id="java-logging-warn" %} use the `Warning` logging level when a function fails to perform its intended task. This generally means that the function will raise an exception.  Do not include occurrences of self-healing events (for example, when a request will be automatically retried).

{% include requirement/MAY id="java-logging-slowlinks" %} log the request and response (see below) at the `Warning` logging level when a request/response cycle (to the start of the response body) exceeds a service-defined threshold.  The threshold should be chosen to minimize false-positives and identify service issues.

{% include requirement/MUST id="java-logging-info" %} use the `Informational` logging level when a function operates normally.

{% include requirement/MUST id="java-logging-verbose" %} use the `Verbose` logging level for detailed troubleshooting scenarios. This is primarily intended for developers or system administrators to diagnose specific failures.

{% include requirement/MUST id="java-logging-no-sensitive-info" %} only log headers and query parameters that are in a service-provided "allow-list" of approved headers and query parameters.  All other headers and query parameters must have their values redacted.

{% include requirement/MUST id="java-logging-requests" %} log request line and headers as an `Informational` message. The log should include the following information:

* The HTTP method.
* The URL.
* The query parameters (redacted if not in the allow-list).
* The request headers (redacted if not in the allow-list).
* An SDK provided request ID for correlation purposes.
* The number of times this request has been attempted.

This happens within azure-core by default, but users can configure this through the builder `httpLogOptions` configuration setting.

{% include requirement/MUST id="java-logging-responses" %} log response line and headers as an `Informational` message.  The format of the log should be the following:

* The SDK provided request ID (see above).
* The status code.
* Any message provided with the status code.
* The response headers (redacted if not in the allow-list).
* The time period between the first attempt of the request and the first byte of the body.

{% include requirement/MUST id="java-logging-cancellations" %} log an `Informational` message if a service call is cancelled.  The log should include:

* The SDK provided request ID (see above).
* The reason for the cancellation (if available).

{% include requirement/MUST id="java-logging-exceptions" %} log exceptions thrown as a `Warning` level message. If the log level set to `Verbose`, append stack trace information to the message.

{% include requirement/MUST id="java-logging-log-and-throw" %} throw all exceptions created within the client library code through one of the logger APIs - `ClientLogger.logThrowableAsError()`, `ClientLogger.logThrowableAsWarning()`, `ClientLogger.logExceptionAsError()` or `ClientLogger.logExceptionAsWarning()`.

For example:

```java
// NO!!!!
if (priority != null && priority < 0) {
    throw new IllegalArgumentException("'priority' cannot be a negative value. Please specify a zero or positive long value.");
}

// Good

// Log any Throwable as error and throw the exception
if (!file.exists()) {
    throw logger.logThrowableAsError(new IOException("File does not exist " + file.getName()));
}

// Log any Throwable as warning and throw the exception
if (!file.exists()) {
    throw logger.logThrowableAsWarning(new IOException("File does not exist " + file.getName()));
}

// Log a RuntimeException as error and throw the exception
if (priority != null && priority < 0) {
    throw logger.logExceptionAsError(new IllegalArgumentException("'priority' cannot be a negative value. Please specify a zero or positive long value."));
}

// Log a RuntimeException as warning and throw the exception
if (numberOfAttempts < retryPolicy.getMaxRetryCount()) {
    throw logger.logExceptionAsWarning(new RetryableException("A transient error occurred. Another attempt will be made after " + retryPolicy.getDelay()));
}
```

### Distributed tracing

Distributed tracing is uncommon in a mobile context. If you feel like you need to support distributed tracing, contact the [Azure SDK mobile team](mailto:azuresdkmobileteam@microsoft.com) for advice.

## Testing

One of the key things we want to support is to allow consumers of the library to easily write repeatable unit-tests for their applications without activating a service. This allows them to reliably and quickly test their code without worrying about the vagaries of the underlying service implementation (including, for example, network conditions or service outages). Mocking is also helpful to simulate failures, edge cases, and hard to reproduce situations (for example: does code work on February 29th).

{% include requirement/MUST id="android-testing-patterns" %} parameterize all applicable unit tests to make use of all available HTTP clients and service versions. Parameterized runs of all tests must occur as part of live tests. Shorter runs, consisting of just Netty and the latest service version, can be run whenever PR validation occurs.

## Other Android-related considerations

> TODO: Revisit min API level chosen.

Android developers need to concern themselves with the runtime environment they are running in. The Android ecosystem is fragmented, with a wide variety of runtimes deployed.

{% include requirement/MUST id="android-library-sync-support" %} support at least Android API level 15 and later (Ice Cream Sandwich). This value can be found in your project's top level `build.gradle` file as `minSdkVersion`.

There are two things that are of concern when discussing the minimum API level to choose:

1. The minimum API level that Google supports.
2. The reach of selecting a particular API level.

We require the minimum API level that Google supports that reaches the most Android devices while still allowing for the use of widely adopted tools by the developer community, such as popular HTTP clients or serialization libraries. We have currently landed on API level 15, which covers more than 99.8% of all Android devices (as of May 2021). The reach of a particular API level can be found when clicking "Help me choose" in Android Studio's "Create New Project" screen, after selecting the type of project to create.

{% include requirement/MUST id="android-library-target-sdk-version" %} set the `targetSdkVersion` to be API level 26 or higher in your project's top level `build.gradle` file.

As of November 2018, all existing Android apps are required to target API level 26 or higher. For more information, see [Improving app security and performance on Google Play for years to come](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2017/12/improving-app-security-and-performance.html).

{% include requirement/MUST id="android-library-max-sdk-version" %} set the `maxSdkVersion` to be the latest API level that you have run tests on in your project's top level `build.gradle` file. This should be the latest API level that is supported by Google at the point at which the SDK is released.

{% include requirement/MUST id="android-library-source-compat" %} set your Gradle project's source and target compatibility level to `1.8`.

{% include requirement/MUST id="android-library-aar" %} release the library as an Android AAR.

{% include requirement/MUST id="android-library-resource-prefix" %} define a `resourcePrefix` of `azure_<service>` in the `build.gradle` android section if using resources.

{% include requirement/SHOULD id="android-library-shrink-code" %} include a Proguard configuration in the AAR to assist developers in correctly minifying their applications when using the library.

{% include requirement/MUST id="android-library-proguard" %} use `consumerProguardFiles` if you include a Proguard configuration in the library.

{% include refs.md %}
{% include_relative refs.md %}
