# Requirements Implemented by HttpPipeline 

This section describes requirements that are automatically satisfied by components that use the [HttpPipeline](#dotnet-usage-httppipeline) to implement their service method calls. 

For example, the pipeline automatically takes care of [logging](#general-logging), [retry](#general-retry), and [telemetry](#general-telemetry) requirements described in detail in this section. 

If for some reason you cannot use the _HttpPipeline_ for a REST service, you will have to manually support the requirements described in this section.

# Context and Rationale

Language-specific guidelines, described above, stem from language-independent requirements described in this section. If you follow the language-specific guidelines, you don't have to worry about these language-independent guidelines, but they do provide context and rationale for many of the language specific guidelines.
