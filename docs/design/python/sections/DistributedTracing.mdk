## Distributed Tracing
~ Draft

~~ Must
create a new trace span for each library method invocation. The easiest way to do so is by adding the distributed tracing decorator from `azure.core.tracing`.
~~

~~ Must
use `<package name>/<method name>` as the name of the span.
~~

~~ Must
create a new span for each outgoing network call. If using the HTTP pipeline, the new span is created for you.
~~

~~ Must
propagate tracing context on each outgoing service request.
