## Distributed Tracing
~ Draft


~~ Must
create a new trace span for each library method invocation. The easiest way to do so is by adding the the distributed tracing decorator from azure.core.tracing`.
~~

~~ Must
use <package name>/<method name> as the name of the span.
~~

~~ Must
create a new span for each outgoing network call. This is typically done by the HTTP Pipeline.
~~

~~ Must
propagate tracing context on each outgoing service request.
