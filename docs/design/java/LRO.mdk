~ Must
name all long-running operations with the `begin` prefix.
~
 
~ Must
use the `com.azure.core.polling.Poller` class to represent long-running operations. The long-running operation API pattern should resemble the following code:

```java
public class <service_name>Client {

    // Poller<T> is a type in azure core
    public Poller<T> begin<operation_name>(<parameters>) {
        return new Poller<>(...);
    }
}
```
