~ Must
name all long-running operations with the `begin` prefix.
~
 
~ Must
use the `com.azure.core.polling` classes, most notably the `Poller` class, to represent long-running operations. The basic long-running operation API pattern should resemble the following:

```java
public class <service_name>Client {

    // Poller<T> is a type in azure core
    public Poller<T> begin<operation_name>(<parameters>) {
        return new Poller<>(...);
    }
}
```
