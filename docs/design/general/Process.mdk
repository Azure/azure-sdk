## Process

Building a new client library is a multi-month effort requiring careful design, review, and testing.  

### Starting the Client Library Design Process

You should start the client library design process at **the same time that you start thinking about the public facing interfaces** for your Azure service.  At this point in time, you can [engage with an API Design Architect with an initial design meeting](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-pr/issues/new/choose).  During this meeting, you will discuss the service offering and a proposed REST API design with the architect, who will offer advice on the proposed REST API design and suggestions on client library experience.

Once you have a solid [REST API Design](https://github.com/Microsoft/api-guidelines), you should build the appropriate [Swagger](https://github.com/Azure/adx-documentation-pr/wiki) file and get it approved through the [Azure OpenAPI Hub](https://portal.azure-devex-tools.com/app).  Alongside this effort, you can start building client libraries for each language, integrate the library into the appropriate monorepo for the language, and onboard to the [Azure SDK Engineering Systems](https://aka.ms/jointhesdk).

### Review Process

Your first step in building the client library should be designing the API surface that the consumer will utilize to access your service.  Like all design processes, this involves identifying the champion scenarios - a set of key use cases that you expect the majority of your users to use to access your service.  Once the champion scenarios are identified, you will write the same code that the consumer of your client library will write to fulfill the champion scenarios, complete with integration with other services, error handling, and debugging points.  This exercise informs the design of the API surface.

Once you have an initial design for the API surface, engage [adparch](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-pr/issues/new/choose) again to schedule a full architectural review of your API surface.  You should schedule this before major development starts on your client library as changes can be requested during the adparch review.

Approval of your API design indicates that you can work with the [Azure SDK Engineering Systems](https://aka.ms/jointhesdk) group on releasing your client libraries to the various language-specific repositories.
