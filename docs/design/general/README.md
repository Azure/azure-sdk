# Creating design guidelines for a new language

If you wish to create design guidelines for a new language:

1. Create a folder for the design guidelines in the folder above this one.
2. Copy `DesignGuidelines.mdk` from this folder into your new folder.
3. Look through the other files in this folder.  For guidelines you wish to augment or change:
    * Create a copy of the file and adjust in your own folder.
    * Then update the link in `DesignGuidelines.mdk`.

You can also add new guidelines sections into your own document by adding a link into `DesignGuidelines.mdk`.
