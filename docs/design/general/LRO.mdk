### Long-Running Operations

Long-running operations are operations which consist of an initial request to start the operation followed by polling to determine when the operation has completed or failed. Long-running operations in Azure tend to follow the [REST API guidelines for Long-running Operations](https://github.com/microsoft/api-guidelines/blob/vNext/Guidelines.md#13-long-running-operations), but there are exceptions.

~ Must
represent long-running operations with some object that encapsulates the polling and the operation status. This object, called a "poller", must provide APIs for:

1. querying the current operation state (either asynchronously, which may consult the service, or synchronously which must not)
2. requesting an asynchronous notification when the operation has completed
3. cancelling the operation if cancellation is supported by the service
4. registering disinterest in the operation so polling stops
5. triggering a poll operation manually (automatic polling must be disabled)
6. progress reporting (if supported by the service)
~

~ Must
support the following polling configuration options. Polling configuration may be used only in the absence of relevant retry-after headers from service, and otherwise should be ignored.

* pollInterval
~

~ Must
prefix method names which return a poller with either `begin` or `start`.
~

~ Must
provide a way to instantiate a poller with the serialized state of another poller to begin where it left off, for example by passing the state as a parameter to the same method which started the operation, or by directly instantiating a poller with that state.
~

~ MustNot
cancel the long-running operation when cancellation is requested via a cancellation token. The cancellation token is cancelling the polling operation and should not have any effect on the service.
~

~ Must
log polling status as info (including time-to-next-retry)
~

~ Must
expose a progress reporting mechanism to the consumer if the service reports progress as part of the polling operation.  Language-dependent guidelines will present additional guidance on how to expose progress reporting in this case.
