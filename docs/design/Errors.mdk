## Error Handling

~ Must
return an error value or throw an exception object when any HTTP request fails with an HTTP status code that is defined by the service/Swagger as a successful status code. NOTE: These errors should also be logged as errors.
~

~ Must
ensure that the error value/exception object contain the HTTP response (including status code and headers) and originating request (including
URL, query parameters, & headers).
~

~ Must
ensure that if the service returns rich error information (via the response headers or body), the rich information must be available via the
error value/exception object. [TODO] in service-specific properties/fields?
~

~ MustNot
make available the response body stream via the error value/excewption object.
