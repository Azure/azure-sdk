# The Book of Identity

Welcome to the Book of Identity for the Azure SDK. This contains a collection of articles, historical decisions, and other useful information about the non-trivial internals of the Azure Identity SDKs.

The intended audience are folks on the Identity feature crew or anyone wishing to have a deeper understanding of the SDK internals.

## Why?

Like most software, the Azure Identity SDKs are built with numerous design decisions, optimizations, and complexities that can be non-trivial to understand and navigate. Documenting these intricacies helps in several ways:

- Knowledge Sharing: Facilitates the transfer of knowledge within the team and for new members, reducing the onboarding time and helping everyone to understand the reasoning behind certain design choices.
- Maintenance: Helps in maintaining and evolving the SDKs by providing a clear historical context and rationale behind existing implementations.
- Troubleshooting: Aids in debugging and resolving issues by having a comprehensive reference that outlines the internal workings and decision-making processes.
- Innovation: Encourages innovative thinking by providing a deep understanding of the current state, which can inspire new ideas and improvements.
