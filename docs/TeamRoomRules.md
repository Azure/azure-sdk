## Entering the Team Room

:white_check_mark: **DO** greet coworkers when you enter the room in the morning. 
Acceptable greetings end with the phrase "my friends!", or equivalent. For example, "Good morning, my friends!"

:white_check_mark: **DO** be aware that it might feel awkward in the first week on the team, 
but the awkwardness goes away once you realize it's similar to saying "how are you doing?", 
where you don't actually mean what you say.

:ballot_box_with_check: **CONSIDER** exposing coworkers to diverse cultures we celebrate at Microsoft. 
For example, you can substitute "my friends!" (or even the whole greeting) with "mis amigos!", "moi przyjaciele", etc.

:no_entry: **DO NOT** try to sneak in without the greeting, even if your corowkers are "in the zone" glued to their computers.
Studies have shown that the small lost of productivity from interrupting your coworkers 
is offset by an increase of productivity due to better team cohesion.

## Responding to a Greeting

:white_check_mark: **DO** respond to the greeter appropriatelly. 
The reply does not have to, but can, end in "my friend", as it is implied.
