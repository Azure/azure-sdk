  # public API (logical calls)

    brief: Describes Azure client library service method call - a public API
      that involves communication with Azure services.
    note: |
      In cases where OpenTelemetry defines semantic convention for a given area
      (for example, messaging, database or GenAI), the standard OpenTelemetry
      name SHOULD be used instead of the generic ones defined in this section.

      **Span name** SHOULD match the `{Namespace}.{Interface}.{OperationName}` pattern
      following the corresponding operation definition in TypeSpec. When an interface
      is not defined, the name SHOULD be `{Namespace}.{MethodName}`. This pattern matches
      the operation's `crossLanguageDefinitionId` in the generated TypeSpec code model.

      The span name SHOULD be consistent across all languages.

      > [!NOTE]
      >
      > The previous version of this document recommended using the
      > `{client.method}` pattern for span names matching language-specific
      > public API called by the application code.
      >
      > This recommendation is now deprecated in favor of the `{Namespace}.{Interface}.{OperationName}`
      > pattern.
      > Azure code generators and client libraries SHOULD use the new pattern
      > as long as it does not introduce breaking changes to existing stable libraries
      > and SHOULD use the old pattern only for backward compatibility.

      **Span kind** SHOULD be `INTERNAL`.

      **Span status:** MUST be left unset if the API call was successful.
      If the API call failed with an error or exception, span status SHOULD be set to `Error`.

      Span status description SHOULD be set to the error or exception message.

      Refer to the [Recording Errors](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/main/docs/general/recording-errors.md)
      document for general considerations on how to record span status.

      Azure client libraries SHOULD NOT record exceptions on spans and SHOULD record them using logging.

      When a client method creates a new span and internally calls into other public client methods of
      the same or different Azure client library, spans created for inner client methods are suppressed by
      Azure Core implementation. See [Distributed tracing policy] for the details.

      **Span duration:** SHOULD cover the full duration of the method call and, when possible,
      SHOULD include input argument validation and (de)serialization of the request and response.

          This attribute SHOULD be set if an error occurred during the API call and
          the method returns an error or throws an exception.

          If Azure service defines a set of error types, it is RECOMMENDED to use
          the service-defined fully qualified service error type as the value of
          this attribute.

          When there is no service-defined error type, it is RECOMMENDED to use
          the fully qualified type of the exception or error thrown by the client library.

  # HTTP spans
  - id: azure.sdk.http
    type: span
    span_kind: client
    stability: stable
    brief: >
      This span represents an outbound HTTP request. Azure client libraries implement a valid
      subset of [OpenTelemetry HTTP client span conventions](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/main/docs/http/http-spans.md).
    note: |
      The instrumentations SHOULD create an HTTP span for each attempt and redirect
      when sending an HTTP request over the wire.

      **Span name:** SHOULD be {http.request.method}.

      **Span kind** MUST be `CLIENT`.

      **Span status:** MUST be left unset if HTTP status code was in the 1xx, 2xx or
      3xx ranges, unless there was another error (e.g., network error receiving the
      response body; or 3xx codes with max redirects exceeded), in which case status
      MUST be set to `Error`.

      For HTTP status codes in the 4xx or 5xx range as well as any other code the
      client failed to interpret, span status SHOULD be set to `Error`.

      > [!Note]
      > The classification of an HTTP status code as an error depends on the context.
      > For example, a 404 "Not Found" status code indicates an error if the application
      > expected the resource to be available. However, it is not an error when
      > the application is simply checking whether the resource exists.
      >
      > Instrumentations that have additional context about a specific request MAY
      > use this context to set the span status more precisely.
      > Instrumentations that don't have any additional context MUST follow the
      > guidelines in this section.

      Don't set the span status description if the reason can be inferred from
      `http.response.status_code`.

      An HTTP request may fail if it was cancelled or an error occurred preventing
      the client or server from sending/receiving the request/response fully.

      When an instrumentation detects such errors it SHOULD set span status to `Error`
      and SHOULD set the `error.type` attribute.

      Azure client libraries SHOULD NOT record exceptions on spans and SHOULD record
      them in logging.

          `url.full` MUST NOT contain credentials passed via URL in form of `https://username:password@www.example.com/`.
          In such cases username and password SHOULD be redacted and attribute's value SHOULD be `https://REDACTED:REDACTED@www.example.com/`.

          `url.full` SHOULD capture the absolute URL when it is available (or can be reconstructed).

          Sensitive content provided in `url.full` SHOULD be scrubbed when instrumentations can identify it.
          Azure client libraries SHOULD redact sensitive content in `url.full` by default consistently

          or a component-specific low cardinality error identifier.

          If response status code was sent or received and status indicates an
          error according to [HTTP span status definition](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/main/docs/http/http-spans.md),
          `error.type` SHOULD be set to the status code number (represented as a string),
          an exception type (if thrown) or a component-specific error identifier.

          If the request has completed successfully, instrumentations SHOULD NOT set `error.type`.
