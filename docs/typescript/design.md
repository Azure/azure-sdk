The API surface of your client library must have the most thought as it is the primary interaction that the consumer has with your service.

## Platform Support {#ts-platform-support}

{% include requirement/MUST id="ts-node-support" %} support [all LTS versions of Node](https://github.com/nodejs/Release#release-schedule) and newer versions up to and including the latest release.

{% include requirement/MUST id="ts-browser-support" %} support the following browsers and versions:

* Apple Safari: latest two versions
* Google Chrome: latest two versions
* Microsoft Edge: all supported versions
* Mozilla FireFox: latest two versions

Use [caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com) to determine whether you can use a given platform feature in the runtime versions you support. Syntax support is provided by TypeScript.

{% include requirement/SHOULDNOT id="ts-no-ie11-support" %} support IE11. If you have a business justification for IE11 support, contact the [Architecture Board].

{% include requirement/MUST id="ts-support-ts" %} compile without errors on all versions of TypeScript greater than 3.1.

While consumers are fast at adopting new versions of TypeScript, version 3.1 is used by Angular 7, which is still commonly used.  Supporting older versions of TypeScript can be a challenge. There are two general approaches:

1. Don't use new features.
2. Use [`typesVersions`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-1.html#version-selection-with-typesversions), which might require manual effort to produce typings compatible with older versions based on the new typings.

{% include requirement/MUST id="ts-register-dropped-platforms" %} get approval from the [Architecture Board] to drop support for any platform (except IE11 and Node 6) even if support isn't required.

## Namespaces, NPM Scopes, and Distribution Tags {#ts-namespace}

{% include requirement/MUST id="ts-azure-scope" %} publish your library to the `@azure` npm scope.

{% include requirement/MUST id="ts-namespace-serviceclient" %} pick a package name that allows the consumer to tie the namespace to the service being used.  As a default, use the compressed service name at the end of the namespace.  The namespace does **NOT** change when the branding of the product changes. Avoid the use of marketing names that may change.

{% include requirement/MUST id="ts-npm-dist-tag-beta" %} tag beta packages with the npm distribution tag `next`. If there is no generally available release of this package, it should also be tagged `latest`.

{% include requirement/MUST id="ts-npm-dist-tag-next" %} tag generally available npm packages `latest`. Generally available packages may also be tagged `next` if they include the changes from the most recent beta.

{% include requirement/MUST id="ts-npm-package-name-prefix" %} prefix your data plane package names with the kebab-case version of the appropriate namespace from the following table:

{% include tables/data_namespaces.md %}

For example, these package names meet the guidelines:

* `@azure/cosmos`
* `@azure/storage-blob`
* `@azure/digital-twins-core`

The following are examples that do not meet the guidelines:

* `@microsoft/cosmos` (not in `@azure` scope).
* `@azure/digitaltwins` (not kebab-cased).

{% include requirement/SHOULD id="ts-npm-package-name-follow-conventions" %} you should follow the casing conventions of any existing GA packages released in the `@azure` npm scope. It's not worth renaming a package just to align on naming conventions.

## The Client API {#ts-apisurface-serviceclient}

Your API surface will consist of one or more _service clients_ that the consumer will instantiate to connect to your service, plus a set of supporting types. The basic shape of JavaScript service clients is shown in the following example:

```javascript
export class ServiceClient {
  // client constructors have overloads for handling different
  // authentication schemes.
  constructor(connectionString: string, options?: ServiceClientOptions);
  constructor(host: string, credential: TokenCredential, options?: ServiceClientOptions);
  constructor(...) { }

  // Service methods. Options take at least an abortSignal.
  async createItem(options?: CreateItemOptions): CreateItemResponse;
  async deleteItem(options?: DeleteItemOptions): DeleteItemResponse;

  // Simple paginated API
  listItems(): PagedAsyncIterableIterator<Item, ItemPage> { }

  // Clients for sub-resources
  getItemClient(itemName: string) { }
}
```

### Client constructors and factories

{% include requirement/MUST id="ts-apisurface-serviceclientnamespace" %} place service client types that the consumer is most likely to interact as a top-level export from your library.  That is, the service client type should be something that can be imported directly by the consumer.

{% include requirement/MUST id="ts-apisurface-serviceclientconstructor" %} allow the consumer to construct a service client with the minimal information needed to connect and authenticate to the service.

{% include requirement/MUST id="ts-apisurface-standardized-verbs" %} standardize verb prefixes within a set of client libraries for a service (see [approved verbs](#ts-approved-verbs)).

The service speaks about specific operations in a cross-language manner within outbound materials (such as documentation, blogs, and public speaking).  The service can't be consistent across languages if the same operation is referred to by different verbs in different languages.

{% include requirement/MUST id="ts-apisurface-supportallfeatures" %} support 100% of the features provided by the Azure service the client library represents.

Gaps in functionality cause confusion and frustration among developers. A feature may be omitted if there isn't support on the platform. For example, a library that depends on local file system access may not work in a browser.

{% include requirement/SHOULD id="ts-use-constructor-overloads" %} provide overloaded constructors for all client construction scenarios.

Don't use static methods to construct a client unless an overload would be ambiguous.  Prefix the static method with `from` if you require a static constructor.

{% include requirement/SHOULD id="ts-use-overloads-over-unions" %} prefer overloads over unions when either:

1. Users want to see documentation (for example, signature help) tailored specifically to the parameters they're passing in, or
2. Multiple parameters are correlated.

Unions may be used if neither of these conditions are met. Let's say we have an API that takes either two numbers or two strings but not both. In this case, the parameters are correlated. If we implemented the types using unions like the following code:

```javascript
function foo(a: string | number, b: string | number): void {}
```

We have mistakenly allowed invalid arguments; that is `foo(number, string)` and `foo(string, number)`. Overloads naturally express this correlation:

```javascript
function foo(a: string, b: string): void;
function foo(a: number, b: number): void;
function foo(a: string | number, b: string | number): void {}
```

The overload approach also lets us attach documentation to each overload individually.

```javascript
// bad example
class ExampleClient {
  constructor (connectionString: string, options: ExampleClientOptions);
  constructor (url: string, options: ExampleClientOptions);
  constructor (urlOrCS: string, options: ExampleClientOptions) {
    // have to dig into the first parameter to see whether its
    // a url or a connection string. Not ideal.
  }
}

// better example
class ExampleClient {
  constructor (url: string, options: ExampleClientOptions) {

  }

  static fromConnectionString(connectionString: string, options: ExampleClientOptions) {

  }
}
```

### Service Versions {#ts-service-versions}

{% include requirement/MUST id="ts-service-versions-use-latest" %} call the highest supported service API version by default.

{% include requirement/MUST id="ts-service-versions-select-api-version" %} allow the consumer to explicitly select a supported service API version when instantiating the client if multiple service versions are supported.

{% include requirement/MUST id="ts-service-versions-use-client-options" %} provide a `serviceVersion` option in the client constructor's option bag for providing a service version. The type of this should be a string literal union with supported service versions. You may also provide a string enum with supported service versions.

### Options {#ts-options}

The guidelines in this section apply to options passed in options bags to clients, whether methods or constructors. When referring to option names, this means the key of the object users must use to specify that option when passing it into a method or constructor.

{% include requirement/MUST id="ts-naming-options" %} name the type of the options bag as `<class name>Options` and `<method name>Options` for constructors and methods respectively.

{% include requirement/MUST id="ts-options-abortSignal" %} name abort signal options `abortSignal`.

{% include requirement/MUST id="ts-options-suffix-durations" %} suffix durations with `In<Unit>`. Unit should be `ms` for milliseconds, and otherwise the name of the unit. Examples include `timeoutInMs` and `delayInSeconds`.

#### Retry-specific Options {#ts-retry-options}

Many services have a notion of retries and have various means to configure them.

{% include requirement/MUST id="ts-use-retry-option-names" %} use the option names specified in the table below

| Option | Values | Usage | Other Names (informational) |
|--------|-------|------|------|
| retryMode | 'fixed', 'linear', 'exponential' | Used to specify the retry strategy |
| maxRetries | number >= 0 | Number of times to retry. 0 effectively disables retrying. |
| retryDelayInMs | number > 0 | Delay between retries. For linear and exponential strategies, this is the initial retry delay and increases thereafter based on the strategy used. |
| maxRetryDelayInMs | number > 0 | Maximum delay between retries. For linear and exponential strategies, this effectively clamps the maximum amount of time between retries. |
| tryTimeoutInMs | number > 0 | How long to wait for a particular retry to complete before giving up |

TODO: Please add a code sample showing how these fit into a track 2 JS/TS library.

{% include requirement/MUST id="ts-use-retry-strategies" %} support the following retry strategies:

* `fixed`: retry after some duration, where the duration never changes.
* `exponential`: retry after some duration, where the duration increases exponentially after each attempt.

TODO: Are these implemented by default in Azure Core or does the API designer need to implement these?  If there is no action for the API Designer, let's take this out.

### Response formats {#ts-responses}

Requests to the service fall into two basic groups - methods that make a single logical request, or a deterministic sequence of requests.  An example of a *single logical request* is a request that may be retried inside the operation.  An example of a *deterministic sequence of requests* is a paged operation. The *logical entity* is a protocol neutral representation of a response. For HTTP, the logical entity may combine data from headers, the body, and the status line.  For example, you may add the `ETag` header as a property on the logical entity to the deserialized content from the body of the response.

{% include requirement/MUST id="ts-return-logical-entities" %} optimize for returning the logical entity for a given request. The logical entity MUST represent the information needed in the 99%+ case.

TODO: the above guideline is a little vague and I'm not sure how to concretely apply this in JS/TS.

{% include requirement/MUST id="ts-return-expose-raw" %} *make it possible* for a developer to get access to the complete response, including the status line, headers, and body.

TODO: a code sample to go with this might be nice, or a direct discussion of the typical response format and how to do this in JS/TS.  As an example of this, .NET discusses Response\<T\> in this section rather than the general guidelines, since Response\<T\> solves this problem for the API designer and then they don't have to think of another way to do it.

{% include requirement/MUST id="ts-return-document-raw-stream" %} document how to access the raw and streamed response for a request (if exposed by the client library).  Include comprehensive samples.  We don't expect all methods to expose a streamed response.

TODO: Should the above guideline go in the Samples section?

For methods that combine multiple requests into a single call:

{% include requirement/MUSTNOT id="general-return-no-headers-if-confusing" %} return headers and other per-request metadata unless it's obvious as to which specific HTTP request the methods return value corresponds to.

TODO: It's unclear regarding the above that this is referring to the model type.  (Is it?)  An example of how we've solved this problem in existing Track 2 JS/TS APIs would be helpful here to make this guideline more actionable.  

{% include requirement/MUST id="general-expose-data-for-composite-failures" %} provide enough information in failure cases for an application to take appropriate corrective action.

TODO: Would the above guideline go better in the Exceptions & Errors section?  In the training, we say that exceptions should A) describe the problem and B) tell the developer how to solve the problem.

{% include requirement/SHOULDNOT id="general-dont-use-value" %} use the following property names within a logical entity:

- `object`
- `value`

Using names that are commonly used as reserved words can cause confusion and will cause consistency issues between languages.

<a name="ts-example-return-types"></a>
An example:

```javascript
// Service operation method on a service client
  public async getProperties(
    options: ContainerGetPropertiesOptions = {}
  ): Promise<Models.ContainerGetPropertiesResponse> {
    // ...
  }

// Response type, in this case for a service which returns the
// relevant info in headers. Note how the headers are represented
// in first-class properties with intellisense etc.
export type ContainerGetPropertiesResponse = ContainerGetPropertiesHeaders & {
  /**
   * The underlying HTTP response.
   */
  _response: msRest.HttpResponse & {
      /**
       * The parsed HTTP response headers.
       */
      parsedHeaders: ContainerGetPropertiesHeaders;
    };
};

export interface ContainerGetPropertiesHeaders {
  // ...
  /**
   * @member {PublicAccessType} [blobPublicAccess] Indicated whether data in
   * the container may be accessed publicly and the level of access. Possible
   * values include: 'container', 'blob'
   */
  blobPublicAccess?: PublicAccessType;
  /**
   * @member {boolean} [hasImmutabilityPolicy] Indicates whether the container
   * has an immutability policy set on it.
   */
  hasImmutabilityPolicy?: boolean;
}
```

### Client naming conventions {#ts-client-naming-conventions}

{% include requirement/MUST id="ts-apisurface-serviceclientnaming" %} name service client types with the _Client_ suffix.

{% include requirement/SHOULD id="ts-approved-verbs" %} use one of the approved verbs in the below table when referring to service operations.

|Verb|Parameters|Returns|Comments|
|-|-|-|-|
|`create\<Noun>`|key, item|Created item|Create new item. Fails if item already exists.|
|`upsert\<Noun>`|key, item|Updated or created item|Create new item, or update existing item. Verb is primarily used in database-like services |
|`set\<Noun>`|key, item|Updated or created item|Create new item, or update existing item. Verb is primarily used for dictionary-like properties of a service |
|`update\<Noun>`|key, partial item|Updated item|Fails if item doesn't exist. |
|`replace\<Noun>`|key, item|Replace existing item|Completely replaces an existing item. Fails if the item doesn't exist. |
|`append\<Noun>`|item|Appended item|Add item to a collection. Item will be added last. |
|`add\<Noun>`|index, item|Added item|Add item to a collection. Item will be added at the given index. |
|`get\<Noun>`|key|Item|Will return null if item doesn't exist |
|`list\<Noun>s`||`PagedAsyncIterableIterator<TItem, TPage>`|Return list of items. Returns empty list if no items exist |
|`\<noun>Exists`|key|`bool`|Return true if the item exists. |
|`delete\<Noun>`|key|None|Delete an existing item. Will succeed even if item didn't exist.|
|`remove\<Noun>`|key|None or removed item|Remove item from a collection.|

{% include requirement/MUSTNOT id="ts-naming-drop-noun" %} include the `Noun` when the operation is operating on the resource itself,  For example, if you have an `ItemClient` with a delete method, it should be called `delete` rather than `deleteItem`. The noun is implicitly `this`.

{% include requirement/MUST id="ts-naming-subclients" %} prefix methods that create or vend subclients with `get` and suffix with `client`.  For example, `container.getBlobClient()`.

TODO: Put the above with the discussion of hierarchical clients?

TODO: A code sample here would help illustrate this.

<a name="ts-example-naming"></a>
The following are good examples of names for operations in a TypeScript client library:

```javascript
containerClient.listBlobs();
containerClient.delete();
```

The following are bad examples:

```javascript
containerClient.deleteContainer(); // don't include noun for direct manipulation
containerClient.newBlob(); // use create instead of new
containerClient.createOrUpdate(); // use upsert
containerClient.createBlobClient(); // should be `getBlobClient`.
```

### Network requests {#ts-network-requests}

When an application makes a network request, the network infrastructure (like routers) and the called service may take a long time to respond. In fact, the network infrastructure may never respond. A well-written application should **NEVER** give up its control to the network infrastructure or service.

Consider the following examples. An orchestrator needs to stop a service because of a scaling operation, reconfiguration, or upgrading to a new version). The orchestrator typically notifies a running service instance by sending an interrupt signal. The service should stop as quickly as possible when it receives this signal. Similarly, when a web server receives a request, it may set a time limit indicating how much time it's allowing before giving a response to the user. A UI application may offer the user a cancel button when making a network request.

The best way for consumers to work with cancellation is to think of cancellation objects as forming a tree. For example:

- Cancelling a parent automatically cancels its children.
- Children can time out sooner than their parent but can't extend the total time.
- Cancellation can happen because of a timeout or an explicit request.

TODO: Regarding the above discussion ... is it needed?  Could we just say the Azure SDK requires service calls to be cancellable and here are the rules for how to do it in JS/TS?  Please consider adding a code sample for this, and if there are implementation specifics for this, it might be nice to have them in the Implementation section (but the latter is technically out of scope for MQ).

{% include requirement/MUST %} accept an `AbortSignalLike` parameter on all asynchronous calls. This type is provided by `@azure/abort-controller`.

{% include requirement/SHOULD %} only check cancellation tokens on I/O calls (such as network requests and file loads).  Don't check the cancellation token between I/O calls within the client library (for example, when processing data between I/O calls).

TODO: Does JS/TS use cancellation tokens?

{% include requirement/MUSTNOT %} leak the underlying protocol transport implementation details to the consumer.  All types from the protocol transport implementation must be appropriately abstracted.

### Authentication

Azure services use different kinds of authentication schemes to allow clients to access the service.  Conceptually, there are two entities responsible in this process: a credential and an authentication policy.  Credentials provide confidential authentication data.  Authentication policies use the data provided by a credential to authenticate requests to the service.

{% include requirement/MUST id="ts-apisurface-supportcancellation" %} support all authentication techniques that the service supports.

{% include requirement/MUST id="ts-apisurface-check-cancel-on-io-calls" %} use credential and authentication policy implementations from the Azure Core library where available.

TODO: Please mention the specific type examples to make this more actionable.

{% include requirement/MUST id="general-apisurface-no-leaking-implementation" %} provide credential types that can be used to fetch all data needed to authenticate a request to the service. Credential types should be non-blocking and atomic.  Use credential types from the `@azure/core-auth` library where possible.

{% include requirement/MUST id="general-apisurface-auth-in-constructors" %} provide service client constructors or factories that accept any supported authentication credentials.

Client libraries may support connection strings __ONLY IF__ the service provides a connection string to users via the portal or other tooling. Connection strings are easily integrated into an application by copy/paste from the portal.  However, connection strings don't allow the credentials to be rotated within a running process.

{% include requirement/MUSTNOT id="general-apisurface-no-connection-strings" %} support constructing a service client with a connection string unless such connection string is available within tooling (for copy/paste operations).

TODO: Please make this section more actionable with regard to what JS/TS does specifically.

### Modern & Idiomatic JavaScript {#ts-modern-javascript}

{% include requirement/MUST id="ts-use-promises" %} use built-in promises for asynchronous operations. You may provide overloads that take a callback. Don't import a polyfill or library to implement promises.

Promises were added to JavaScript ES2015. ES2016 and later added `async` functions to make working with promises easier. Promises are broadly supported in JavaScript runtimes, including all currently supported versions of Node.

{% include requirement/SHOULD id="ts-use-async-functions" %} use `async` functions for implementing asynchronous library APIs.

If you need to support ES5 and are concerned with library size, use `async` when combining asynchronous code with control flow constructs.  Use promises for simpler code flows.  `async` adds code bloat (especially when targeting ES5) when transpiled.

{% include requirement/MUST id="ts-use-iterators" %} use [Iterators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Iterators_and_Generators) and [Async Iterators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for-await...of) for sequences and streams of all sorts.

Both iterators and async iterators are built into JavaScript and easy to consume. Other streaming interfaces (such as node streams) may be used where appropriate as long as they're idiomatic.

{% include requirement/SHOULD id="ts-use-interface-parameters" %} prefer interface types to class types. JavaScript is fundamentally a duck-typed language, and so alternative classes that implement the same interface should be allowed. Declare parameters as interface types over class types whenever possible. Overloads with specific class types are fine but there should be an overload present with the generic interface.

<a name="ts-example-iterators"></a>

```javascript
// bad synchronous example
function listItems() {
  return {
    nextItem() { /*...*/ }
  }
}

// better synchronous example
function* listItems() {
  /* ... */
}

// bad asynchronous examples
function listItems() {
  return Rx.Observable.of(/* ... */)
}

function listItems(callback) {
  // fetch items
  for (const item of items) {
    callback (item)
    }
}

// better asynchronous example
async function* listItems() {
  for (const item of items) {
    yield item;
  }
}
```
~

### Modern & Idiomatic TypeScript {#ts-modern-typescript}

{% include requirement/MUST id="ts-use-typescript" %} implement your library in TypeScript.

{% include requirement/MUST id="ts-ship-type-declarations" %} include type declarations for your library.

TypeScript static types provide significant benefit for both the library authors and consumers. TypeScript also compiles modern JavaScript language features for use with older runtimes.

#### tsconfig.json {#ts-tsconfig.json}

Your `tsconfig.json` should look similar to the following example:
<a name="ts-figure-tsconfig-json"></a>

```javascript
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "declaration": true,
    "module": "es6",
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "strict": true,
    "noUnusedLocals": true,
    "noUnusedParameters": true,
    "noImplicitReturns": true,
    "noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": true,
    "outDir": "./dist-esm",
    "target": "es6",
    "sourceMap": true,
    "declarationMap": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "importHelpers": true
  },
  "include": ["./src/**/*"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules"]
}
```

{% include requirement/MUST id="ts-config-exclude" %} have at least "node_modules" in the `exclude` array. TypeScript shouldn't needlessly type check your dependencies.

{% include requirement/MUSTNOT id="ts-config-lib" %} use the `compilerOptions.lib` field. Built in typescript libraries (for example, `esnext.asynciterable`) should be included via reference directives. See also [Microsoft/TypeScript#27416](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/27416).

{% include requirement/MUST id="ts-config-strict" %} set `compilerOptions.strict` to true. The `strict` flag is a best practice for developers as it provides the best TypeScript experience. The `strict` flag also ensures that your type definitions are maximally pedantic.

{% include requirement/MUST id="ts-config-esModuleInterop" %} set `compilerOptions.esModuleInterop` to true.

{% include requirement/MUST id="ts-config-allowSyntheticDefaultImports" %} set `compilerOptions.allowSyntheticDefaultImports` to true.

{% include requirement/MUST id="ts-config-target" %} set `compilerOptions.target`, but it can be any valid value so long as the final source distributions are compatible with the runtimes your library targets. See also [#ts-source-distros].

{% include requirement/MUST id="ts-config-forceConsistentCasingInFileNames" %} set `compilerOptions.forceConsistentCasingInFileNames` to true. `forceConsistentCasingInFileNames` forces TypeScript to treat files as case sensitive, and ensures you don't get surprised by build failures when moving between platforms.


{% include requirement/MUST id="ts-config-module" %} set `compilerOptions.module` to `es6`. Use a bundler such as [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/) or [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to produce the CommonJS and UMD builds.

{% include requirement/MUST id="ts-config-moduleResolution" %} set `compilerOptions.moduleResolution` to "node" if your library targets Node. Otherwise, it should be absent.

{% include requirement/MUST id="ts-config-declaration" %} set `compilerOptions.declaration` to true. The `--declaration` option tells TypeScript to emit a `d.ts` file that contains the public surface area of your library. TypeScript and editors use this file to provide intellisense and type checking capabilities. Ensure you reference this type declaration file from the `types` field of your package.json.

{% include requirement/MUSTNOT id="ts-config-no-experimentalDecorators" %} set `compilerOptions.experimentalDecorators` to `true`. The experimentalDecorators flag adds support for "v1 decorators" to TypeScript. Unfortunately the standards process has moved on to an incompatible second version that is not yet implemented by TypeScript. Taking a dependency on decorators now means signing up your users for breaking changes later.

{% include requirement/MUST id="ts-config-sourceMap" %} set `compilerOptions.sourceMap` and `compilerOptions.declarationMap` to true. Shipping source maps in your package ensures clients can easily debug into your library code. `sourceMap` maps your emitted JS source to the declaration file and `declarationMap` maps the declaration file back to the TypeScript source that generated it. Be sure to include your original TypeScript sources in the package.

{% include requirement/MUST id="ts-config-importHelpers" %} set `compilerOptions.importHelpers` to true. Using external helpers keeps your package size down. Without this flag, TypeScript will add a helper block to each file that needs it. The file size savings using this option can be huge when using `async` functions (as an example) in a number of different files.

#### TypeScript Coding Guidelines {#ts-coding-guidelines}

{% include requirement/SHOULDNOT id="ts-no-namespaces" %} use TypeScript namespaces. Namespaces either use the `namespace` keyword explicitly, or the `module` keyword with a module name (for example, `module Microsoft.ApplicationInsights { ... }`). Use top-level imports/exports with ECMAScript modules instead. Namespaces make your code less compatible with standard ECMAScript and create significant friction with the TypeScript community.

{% include requirement/SHOULDNOT id="ts-no-const-enums" %} use `const enum`. `Const enum` requires global understanding of your program to compile properly. As a result, `const enum` can't be used with Babel 7, which otherwise supports TypeScript. Avoiding `const enum` will make sure your code can be compiled by any tool. Use regular enums instead.

## Pagination {#ts-pagination}

Most developers will want to process a list one item at a time. Higher-level APIs (for example, async iterators) are preferred in the majority of use cases.  Finer-grained control over handling paginated result sets is sometimes required (for example, to handle over-quota or throttling).

{% include requirement/MUST id="ts-pagination-provide-list" %} provide a `list` method that returns a `PagedAsyncIterableIterator` from the module `@azure/core-paging`.

{% include requirement/MUST id="ts-pagination-provide-bypage-settings" %} provide page-related settings to the `byPage()` iterator and not the per-item iterator.

{% include requirement/MUST id="ts-pagination-take-continuationToken" %} take a `continuationToken` option in the `byPage()` method. You must rename other parameters that perform a similar function (for example, `nextMarker`).  If your page type has a continuation token, it must be named `continuationToken`.

{% include requirement/MUST id="ts-pagination-take-maxpagesize" %} take a `maxPageSize` option in the `byPage()` method.

An example of a paginating client:
<a name="ts-example-pagination"></a>

```javascript
// usage
const client = new ServiceClient()
for await (const item of client.listItems()) {
    console.log(item);
}

for await (const page of client.listItems().byPage({ maxPageSize: 50 })) {
    console.log(page);
}

// implementation
interface Item {
    name: string;
}

interface Page {
    continuationToken: string;
    items: Item[];
}

class ServiceClient {
    /* ... */
    listItems(): PagedAsyncIterableIterator<Item, Page> {
        async function* pages () { /* ... */ }
        async function* items () {
            for (const page of pages()) {
                for (const item of page.items) {
                    yield item;
                }
            }
        }

        const itemIter = items();

        return {
            next() {
                return itemIter.next();
                /* ... */
            },
            byPage() {
                return pages();
            },
            [Symbol.asyncIterator]() { return this }
        }
    }
}
```

{% include requirement/MUST id="general-pagination-paginate-lists" %} expose non-paginated list endpoints identically to paginated list endpoints. Users shouldn't need to appreciate the difference.

{% include requirement/MUST id="general-pagination-distinct-types" %} use different types for entities returned from a `list` endpoint and a `get` endpoint if the returned entities have a different shape.  If both entities are the same form, use the same type.

{% include note.html content="Services should return the same shape for entities from a <code>list</code> endpoint vs. a <code>get</code> endpoint unless there's a good reason for the difference.  Using the same type for both operations will make the API surface in the client library simpler." %}

{% include requirement/MUSTNOT id="general-pagination-no-item-iterators" %} expose an iterator over individual items if it causes additional service requests.  Some services charge on a per-request basis. One `GET` per item is often too expensive when the data isn't used.

{% include requirement/MUSTNOT id="general-pagination-support-toArray" %} expose an API to get a paginated collection into an array. Services may return many pages, which can lead to memory exhaustion in the application.

## Long Running Operations {#ts-lro}

Long-running operations are operations which consist of an initial request to start the operation followed by polling to determine when the operation has completed or failed. Long-running
operations in Azure tend to follow the [REST API guidelines for Long-running Operations][rest-lro], but there are exceptions.

{% include requirement/MUST %} represent long-running operations with some object that encapsulates the polling and the operation status. This object, called a *poller*, must provide APIs for:

1. querying the current operation state (either asynchronously, which may consult the service, or synchronously which must not)
2. requesting an asynchronous notification when the operation has completed
3. cancelling the operation if cancellation is supported by the service
4. registering disinterest in the operation so polling stops
5. triggering a poll operation manually (automatic polling must be disabled)
6. progress reporting (if supported by the service)

{% include requirement/MUST id="ts-lro-support-options" %} support the following polling configuration options:

* `pollInterval`

Polling configuration may be used only in the absence of relevant retry-after headers from service, and otherwise should be ignored.

{% include requirement/MUST id="ts-lro-prefix-methods" %} prefix method names which return a poller with either `begin`.

{% include requirement/MUST id="ts-lro-continuation" %} provide a way to instantiate a poller with the serialized state of another poller to begin where it left off, for example by passing the state as a parameter to the same method which started the operation, or by directly instantiating a poller with that state.

{% include requirement/MUSTNOT id="ts-lro-cancellation" %} cancel the long-running operation when cancellation is requested via a cancellation token. The cancellation token is cancelling the polling operation and should not have any effect on the service.

{% include requirement/MUST id="ts-lro-logging" %} log polling status at the `Info` level (including time to next retry)

{% include requirement/MUST id="ts-lro-progress-reporting" %} expose a progress reporting mechanism to the consumer if the service reports progress as part of the polling operation.  Language-dependent guidelines will present additional guidance on how to expose progress reporting in this case.

{% include draft.html content="Long-running operations will use the <code>@azure/core-lro</code> package, which is an abstraction that provides the above requirements" %}

TODO: If this is largely implemented for the API Designer, please include an example of how to use the Azure Core type in the public API.  It would be ideal to remove guidelines where the requirement has already been addressed for the API Designer in the type.

## Conditional Request Methods {#ts-conditional-requests}

There are two patterns in use depending on whether `etag` is a member of the model type or not.

{% include requirement/MUST id="ts-conditional-request-options-1" %} provide the following options in a method's options bag when the model type has an `etag` property:

* onlyIfChanged - sets the `if-match` header to the `etag`.
* onlyIfUnchanged - sets the `if-none-match` header to the `etag`.
* onlyIfMissing - sets the `if-none-match` header to `*`.
* onlyIfPresent - sets the `if-match` header to `*`.

{% include requirement/MUST id="ts-conditional-request-options-2" %} provide the following options in a method's options bag's `conditions` property when the model type does not have an `etag` property:

* ifMatch - sets the `if-match` header to the value provided.
* ifNoneMatch - sets the `if-none-match` header to the value provided.
* ifModifiedSince - sets the `if-modified-since` header to the value provided
* ifUnmodifiedSince - sets the `if-unmodified-since` header to the value provided.

{% include requirement/MUST id="ts-conditional-request-no-dupe-options" %} throw an error if the user provides options from both option sets, for example passing `onlyIfChanged: true` and `ifMatch: "..."`. In some cases you may want to provide both sets of options, but it is not required or necessarily recommended.

## Model Types {#ts-model-types}

Client libraries represent entities transferred to and from Azure services as model types. Certain types are used for round-trips to the service. They can be sent to the service (as an addition or update operation) and retrieved from the service (as a get operation). These must be named according to the type. For example, a `ConfigurationSetting` in App Configuration, or an `Event` on Event Grid.

{% include requirement/MUST id="ts-model-types-use-good-name" %} follow the above convention for types which round-trip to the service and represent a complete entity.

Data within the model type can generally be split into two parts - data used to support one of the champion scenarios for the service, and less important data. Given a type `Foo`, the less important details can be gathered in a type called `FooDetails` and attached to `Foo` as the `details` property.

For example:

{% highlight typescript %}
interface ConfigurationSettingDetails {
    lastModifiedOn: Date;
    receivedOn: Date;
    etag: string;
}

interface ConfigurationSetting {
    key: string;
    value: string;
    details: ConfigurationSettingDetails;
}
{% endhighlight %}

{% include requirement/MAY id="ts-model-types-use-details" %} use `details` to separate commonly needed and less commonly needed properties. If you use this convention, you MUST follow these naming conventions.

In cases where a partial schema is returned, use the following types:

* `<model>Item` for each item in an enumeration if the enumeration returns a partial schema for the model. For example, `GetBlobs()` return an enumeration of `BlobItem`, which contains the blob name and metadata, but not the content of the blob.
* `<operation>Result` for the result of an operation. The `<operation>` is tied to a specific service operation. If the same result can be used for multiple operations, use a suitable noun-verb phrase instead. For example, use `UploadBlobResult` for the result from `UploadBlob`, but `ContainerChangeResult` for results from the various methods that change a blob container. In cases where a result is just a primitive type, do not create a type alias for it - just use it directly, and do not follow these conventions.

{% include requirement/MUST id="ts-model-types-partial-naming" %} follow the above naming conventions when partial schemas are returned.

The following table enumerates the various models you might create:

| Type | Example | Usage |
| `<model>` | `Secret` | The full data for a resource |
| `<model>Details` | `SecretDetails` | Less important details about a resource. Attached to `<model>.details` |
| `<model>Item` | `SecretItem` | A partial set of data returned for enumeration |
| `<operation>Options` | `AddSecretOptions` | Optional parameters to a single operation |
| `<operation>Result` | `AddSecretResult` | A partial or different set of data for a single operation |
| `<model><verb>Result` | `SecretChangeResult` | A partial or different set of data for multiple operations on a model |

## Using Azure Core {#ts-core-types}

{% include requirement/MUST id="ts-core-types-must" %} make use of packages in Azure Core to provide behavior consistent across all Azure SDK libraries. This includes, but is not limited to:

* `core-http` for http client, pipeline and related functionality
* `logger` for logging
* `core-tracing` for distributed tracing
* `core-auth` for common auth interfaces
* `core-lro` for long running operations

See the [Azure Core readme](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/master/sdk/core) for more details.

TODO: Please add a section on extensible enums, if this is relevant to JS/TS.

## Support for non-HTTP protocols {#general-other-protocols}

Most Azure services expose a RESTful API over HTTPS.  However, a few services use other protocols, such as [AMQP](https://www.amqp.org/), [MQTT](http://mqtt.org/), or [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/). In these cases, the operation of the protocol can be split into two phases:

* Per-connection (surrounding when the connection is initiated and terminated)
* Per-operation (surrounding when an operation is sent through the open connection)

The policies that are added to a HTTP request/response (authentication, unique request ID, telemetry, distributed tracing, and logging) are still valid on both a per-connection and per-operation basis.  However, the methods by which these policies are implemented are protocol dependent.

{% include requirement/MUST id="general-other-protocols-pipeline-policies" %} implement as many of the policies as possible on a per-connection and per-operation basis.

For example, MQTT over WebSockets provides the ability to add headers during the initiation of the WebSockets connection, so this is a good place to add authentication, telemetry, and distributed tracing policies.  However, MQTT has no metadata (the equivalent of HTTP headers), so per-operation policies are not possible.  AMQP, by contract, does have per-operation metadata.  Unique request ID, and distributed tracing headers can be provided on a per-operation basis with AMQP.

{% include requirement/MUST id="general-other-protocols-consult-on-policies" %} consult the [Architecture Board] on policy decisions for non-HTTP protocols.  Implementation of all policies is expected.  If the protocol cannot support a policy, obtain an exception from the [Architecture Board].

{% include requirement/MUST id="general-other-protocols-use-global-config" %} use the global configuration established in the Azure Core library to configure policies for non-HTTP protocols.  Consumers don't necessarily know what protocol is used by the client library.  They will expect the client library to honor global configuration that they have established for the entire Azure SDK.
