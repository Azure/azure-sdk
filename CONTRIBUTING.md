# Azure SDK Contribution Guide

The Azure SDK project welcomes contributions and suggestions.  Most contributions require you to agree to a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have the right to, and actually do, grant us the rights to use your contribution. For details, visit https://cla.microsoft.com.

When you submit a pull request, a CLA-bot will automatically determine whether you need to provide a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., label, comment). Simply follow the instructions provided by the bot. You will only need to do this once across all repos using our CLA.

The [Azure SDK Blog](https://aka.ms/azsdk/blog) welcomes contributions related to the new Azure SDKs.  Please reach out to us here [azsdkblog@microsoft.com](mailto:azsdkblog@microsoft.com) if you are interested in contributing a blog post.
