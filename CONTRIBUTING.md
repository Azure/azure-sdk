# Azure SDK Contribution Guide

The Azure SDK project welcomes contributions and suggestions.  Most contributions require you to agree to a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have the right to, and actually do, grant us the rights to use your contribution. For details, visit <https://cla.microsoft.com>.

When you submit a pull request, a CLA-bot will automatically determine whether you need to provide a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., label, comment). Simply follow the instructions provided by the bot. You will only need to do this once across all repos using our CLA.

## Azure SDK Blog Contributions

The [Azure SDK Blog](https://aka.ms/azsdk/blog) welcomes contributions related to the new Azure SDKs. Please reach out to us here [azsdkblog@microsoft.com](mailto:azsdkblog@microsoft.com) if you are interested in contributing a blog post.

## Azure SDK GitHub Pages Site Contributions

Here's the general contribution process:

1. Fork this repo.
1. Create a new branch.
1. Commit your changes to that branch.
1. Do a PR from your fork/branch to azure-sdk/main.

## Codespaces

**(Recommended)**
Codespaces is new technology that allows you to use a container as your development environment. This repo provides a Codespaces container which is supported by both GitHub Codespaces and VS Code Codespaces.

### GitHub Codespaces

1. From the Azure SDK GitHub repo, click on the `Code` button then `Open with Codespaces`.
1. Open a terminal pane.
1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+T` or execute the following command and `Ctrl+Click` the link generated. A new window will open with the Azure SDK website.

    ```bash
    bundle exec jekyll serve
    ```

> When you click the link in Codespaces for the running server, like `http://127.0.0.1:4000/azure-sdk/`, you will be redirected to the Codespaces url, which will not contain the URL path at the end `azure-sdk/` and will display a `Not Found` error. To fix it, add the `azure-sdk/` path at the end.

### VS Code Devcontainer

1. Install the [VS Code Remote Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack)
1. When you open the Azure SDK repo in VS Code, it will prompt you to open the project in the Devcontainer. If it does not prompt you, press `F1`, and select `Dev Containers: Open Folder in Container...`/
1. Open a terminal pane.
1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+T` or execute the following command and `Ctrl+Click` the link generated. A new window will open with the Azure SDK website.

    ```bash
    bundle exec jekyll serve
    ```

## Full Local Setup

> Note: We recommend you use [codespaces](#codespaces) documented above.
> Getting the right version of Ruby with system dependencies and corresponding gems can be difficult and may not match the `Gemfile.lock` that was generated in a devcontainer.
> If you want to work locally, you might consider `rbenv` to create a virtual Ruby environment which minimizes conflicts with other installations.
