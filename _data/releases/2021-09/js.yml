    #### Breaking Changes

    * Reversed the order of `credentials` and `endpoint` in `AttestationAdministrationClient` to be
    consistent with other SDKs.
    * Removed `credentials` top level parameter for `AttestationClient` constructor, moved
    to the `AttestationClientOptions` object.
    * Renamed the `validateToken` API in the `AttestationToken` class to `getTokenProblems` returning
    an array of strings.
    * Attestation Policy APIs (`setPolicy`, `resetPolicy`) have had their `privateKey` and `certificate` parameters moved to options.
    * Renamed `instanceUrl` to `endpoint` to be consistent with other APIs.
    * Removed `policyCertificates` from `AttestationAdministrationClient`.
    * Removed `StoredAttestationPolicy` and replaced it with `AttestationPolicyToken`.
    * Removed `AttestationData` type. Instead of specifying an `AttestationData` for `initTimeData` and `runTimeData` to the Attest APIs, the attest APIs take an `initTimeJson`, `initTimeData`, `runTimeData` and `runTimeJson` object and determine
    the `DataType` to send to the server based on that.
    * Removed the `AttestationSigningKey` model type replaced with two parameters
    `privateKey` and `certificate` to the APIs which used to accept an `AttestationSigningKey`
    * Renamed `AttestationResponse.value` to `AttestationResponse.body` to align with
    API guidelines.

    #### Features Added

    Added hand authored implementation for policy management certificate APIs: `getPolicyManagementCertificates`, `addPolicyManagementCertificate` and `removePolicyManagementCertificate`.

    Simplified the calling pattern for the Attest family of APIs.
    Simplified some model types to be reflected as either parameters or interfaces.
    The attestation family of APIs no longer requires authentication credentials.
    The attestation family of APIs now accepts Blob objects in addition to Uint8Array
    and Buffer objects as inputs.
