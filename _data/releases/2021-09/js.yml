    #### Breaking Changes

    * Reversed the order of `credentials` and `endpoint` in `AttestationAdministrationClient` to be
    consistent with other SDKs.
    * Removed `credentials` top level parameter for `AttestationClient` constructor, moved
    to the `AttestationClientOptions` object.
    * Renamed the `validateToken` API in the `AttestationToken` class to `getTokenProblems` returning
    an array of strings.
    * Attestation Policy APIs (`setPolicy`, `resetPolicy`) have had their `privateKey` and `certificate` parameters moved to options.
    * Renamed `instanceUrl` to `endpoint` to be consistent with other APIs.
    * Removed `policyCertificates` from `AttestationAdministrationClient`.
    * Removed `StoredAttestationPolicy` and replaced it with `AttestationPolicyToken`.
    * Removed `AttestationData` type. Instead of specifying an `AttestationData` for `initTimeData` and `runTimeData` to the Attest APIs, the attest APIs take an `initTimeJson`, `initTimeData`, `runTimeData` and `runTimeJson` object and determine
    the `DataType` to send to the server based on that.
    * Removed the `AttestationSigningKey` model type replaced with two parameters
    `privateKey` and `certificate` to the APIs which used to accept an `AttestationSigningKey`
    * Renamed `AttestationResponse.value` to `AttestationResponse.body` to align with
    API guidelines.

    #### Features Added

    Added hand authored implementation for policy management certificate APIs: `getPolicyManagementCertificates`, `addPolicyManagementCertificate` and `removePolicyManagementCertificate`.

    Simplified the calling pattern for the Attest family of APIs.
    Simplified some model types to be reflected as either parameters or interfaces.
    The attestation family of APIs no longer requires authentication credentials.
    The attestation family of APIs now accepts Blob objects in addition to Uint8Array
    and Buffer objects as inputs.

  ChangelogContent: |-
    #### Features Added

    - Support caching of registered schemas and send requests to the service only if the cache does not have the looked-up schema/schema ID.

    #### Breaking Changes

    - Change SchemaRegistryClient.getSchemaId and SchemaRegistryClient.getSchemaById to return `undefined` instead of throwing when schema is not found ([Issue #15130](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/issues/15130))
    - Move generated client to use @azure/core-rest-pipeline. For more information about Core V2, please refer to [the documentation](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/main/sdk/core#core-v1-and-core-v2).
    - With this change, the response types no longer contain the raw response `_response`. To access the raw response, an `onResponse` callback has to be passed in the request options bag.

    ```typescript
    let createResult: FullOperationResponse | undefined;
    await client.getSchemaById(id, { onResponse: (response) => (createResult = response) });
    ```
