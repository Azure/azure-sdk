    #### Bugs Fixed
    - Fixed an issue that made getting entities from a Cosmos endpoint fail as it does not return a `Timestamp@odata.type` property in a `TableEntity` alongside the `Timestamp` property, like Storage endpoint do. This is apparently intended behavior, so we now always convert `Timestamp` to `OffsetDateTime` as it is a reserved property name and will always be provided by the service.
    - Updated clients to properly map an internal HTTP exception to the public type `TableServiceException` in operations such as `getAccessPolicies()`, `getProperties()`, `setProperties()` and `getStatistics()`, including their `withResponse` variants.
    - Fixed batch operations to properly log exceptions other than `TableTransactionFailedException`.
