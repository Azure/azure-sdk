  Version: 0.19.0
  DisplayName: Core
  ServiceName: Core
  VersionType: Patch
  Hidden: false
  ChangelogUrl: https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/blob/main/sdk/azcore/CHANGELOG.md
  ChangelogContent: |-
    ### Breaking Changes
    * Split content out of `azcore` into various packages.  The intent is to separate content based on its usage (common, uncommon, SDK authors).
      * `azcore` has all core functionality.
      * `log` contains facilities for configuring in-box logging.
      * `policy` is used for configuring pipeline options and creating custom pipeline policies.
      * `runtime` contains various helpers used by SDK authors and generated content.
      * `streaming` has helpers for streaming IO operations.
    * `NewTelemetryPolicy()` now requires module and version parameters and the `Value` option has been removed.
      * As a result, the `Request.Telemetry()` method has been removed.
    * The telemetry policy now includes the SDK prefix `azsdk-go-` so callers no longer need to provide it.
    * The `*http.Request` in `runtime.Request` is no longer anonymously embedded.  Use the `Raw()` method to access it.
    * The `UserAgent` and `Version` constants have been made internal, `Module` and `Version` respectively.

    ### Bug Fixes
    * Fixed an issue in the retry policy where the request body could be overwritten after a rewind.

    ### Other Changes
    * Moved modules `armcore` and `to` content into `arm` and `to` packages respectively.
      * The `Pipeline()` method on `armcore.Connection` has been replaced by `NewPipeline()` in `arm.Connection`.  It takes module and version parameters used by the telemetry policy.
    * Poller logic has been consolidated across ARM and core implementations.
      * This required some changes to the internal interfaces for core pollers.
    * The core poller types have been improved, including more logging and test coverage.

      `AzureCLITokenProvider`

    ### Bug Fixes
    * `ManagedIdentityCredential.GetToken` returns `CredentialUnavailableError`
      when IMDS has no assigned identity, signaling `DefaultAzureCredential` to
