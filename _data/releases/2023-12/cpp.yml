    #### Breaking Changes

    - Add `WorkloadIdentityCredential` to the `DefaultAzureCredential`.

    #### Bugs Fixed

    - Do not throw an exception during `AzureCliCredential` construction, but rather delay it to the `GetToken()` call.
    - Harden checks for the tenant ID.
    - Disallow space character when validating tenant id and scopes as input for `AzureCliCredential`.
    - Add authority host url validation to reject non-HTTPS schemes.
    - [[#4084]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-cpp/issues/4084) Remove OpenSSL dependency on Windows. (A community contribution, courtesy of _[teo-tsirpanis](https://github.com/teo-tsirpanis)_)

    #### Features Added

    - Added `WorkloadIdentityCredential`.
    - When one of the credentials within `DefaultAzureCredential` is successful, it gets re-used during all subsequent attempts to get the token.
    - Updated `ClientSecretCredentialOptions` and `ClientCertificateCredentialOptions` to read the default value for the authority host option from the environment variable first.
