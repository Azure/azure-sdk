    #### Features Added

    - Made default constructor for `Azure::Core::Uuid` implicit.
    - Added mTLS support to WinHTTP transport.
    - To enable mTLS, first create an appropriate Windows `PCCERT_CONTEXT` object and set the `TlsClientCertificate` field in `WinHttpTransportOptions` to that certificate before creating the `WinHttpTransport` object.
