    #### Features added

    * Added `trace_function` decorator for conveniently tracing function calls in Agents using OpenTelemetry. Please see the README.md for updated documentation.

    #### Bugs Fixed

    * Lowered the logging level of "Toolset is not available in the client" from `warning` to `debug` to prevent unnecessary log entries in agent application runs.
