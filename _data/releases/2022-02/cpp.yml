    #### Features Added

    - Enabled environment-controlled console logging on UWP.

    #### Breaking Changes

    - Removed the `AzureNoReturnPath()` function from the global namespace, and deprecated the associated macros, such as `AZURE_ASSERT` since they are meant for internal use only. If your code was using the `AZURE_ASSERT` macro, consider using the standard library's `assert` as an alternative.
    - Removed the two parameter `RequestFailedException` ctor, it has no use case and wasn't intended for public use.

    #### Bugs Fixed

    - Fixed `Azure::DateTime::Parse()` validation if the result is going to exceed `9999-12-31T23:59:59.9999999` due to time zone, leap second, or fractional digits rounding up adjustments.
    - [[#3224]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-cpp/issues/3224) Fixed intermittent crash on macOS when logging is turned on.
