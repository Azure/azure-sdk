  ChangelogContent: |-
    #### Features Added

    - Added a new constructor for `Azure::Core::Context` that takes an `Azure::DateTime` deadline. This enables creating a new context directly with a deadline.
    - Request logs to now include the `accept-range`, `content-range`, `range`, `WWW-Authenticate`, `x-ms-date`, `x-ms-error-code`, `x-ms-range`, and `x-ms-version` headers.
    - Added default constructor, `Parse()`, and equality comparison operators to `Azure::Core::Uuid`.
    - Added an `Azure::Core::ResourceIdentifier` type.

    #### Breaking Changes

    - Deprecated the `Azure::Core::Context::ApplicationContext` object.
    - If customer code is using `Azure::Core::Context::ApplicationContext`, the customer should instead create their own root context object which is used
    wherever the customer would have previously used `Azure::Core::Context::ApplicationContext`, i.e. `Azure::Core::Context(deadline)` instead of `Azure::Core::Context::ApplicationContext.WithDeadline(deadline)`.

    #### Bugs Fixed

    - Throw `std::invalid_argument` if the value of `TimeFractionFormat` enum passed in to `DateTime::ToString()` is invalid.
    - `Azure::Core::Uuid::ToString()` is now `const`.
    - Make the HTTP transport behavior consistent between WinHTTP and libcurl by disabling automatically following redirects on Windows.
    - Added basic input validation to `Azure::Core::ResourceIdentifier` to ensure the prefix match what is expected.

  ChangelogContent: |-
    #### Bugs Fixed

    - Fixed the request sent in `AzurePipelinesCredential` so it doesn't result in a redirect response when an invalid system access token is provided.

    #### Breaking Changes

    - Previously, if a clientId was specified for Cloud Shell managed identity, which is not supported, the clientId was passed into the request body. Now, an exception will be thrown if a clientId is specified for Cloud Shell managed identity.

    #### Features Added

    - Added support for providing an object ID or a resource ID to `ManagedIdentityCredential`.
    - Added support for passing in the x509 certificate and its corresponding private key directly to `ClientCertificateCredential`, rather than reading from a pem file.
    - Added support for sending an x5c parameter in `ClientCertificateCredential`.
