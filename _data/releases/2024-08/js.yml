    #### Features Added

    - Added support for text queries against vector fields [#30494](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/pull/29597)
    - Create text queries against vector fields with the `VectorizedTextQuery` variant of `VectorQuery`. Such queries are supported by configuring the corresponding index field with a `VectorSearchVectorizer`. This configuration describes a delegate, which the service uses to generate vector embeddings for the query text.
    - Added `AzureOpenAIEmbeddingSkill` to allow for `SearchIndexer`s to populate embedding fields at index-time.
    - Added index configuration for vector quantization through `VectorSearchCompression`

    #### Bugs Fixed

    - Improved serialization performance on large payloads [#29597](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/pull/29597)
