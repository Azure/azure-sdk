  ChangelogUrl: https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-cpp/tree/azure-core_1.14.0-beta.1/sdk/core/azure-core/CHANGELOG.md
  ChangelogContent: |-
    #### Features Added

    - Added new constructor for `Azure::Core::Context` that takes a `std::chrono::system_clock::time_point` deadline. This enables creating a new context directly with a deadline.

    #### Breaking Changes

    - Deprecated the `Azure::Core::Context::ApplicationContext` object.
    - If customer code is using `Azure::Core::Context::ApplicationContext`, the customer should instead create their own root context object which is used
    wherever the customer would have previously used `Azure::Core::Context::ApplicationContext`, i.e. `Azure::Core::Context(deadline)` instead of `Azure::Core::Context::ApplicationContext.WithDeadline(deadline)`.
