    #### Features Added

    - Now supports the Assistants V2 API, with support for vector stores as well as streaming.

    #### Breaking Changes

    - Assistants V1 is no longer supported in this library. For information about how to migrate between V1 and V2, see OpenAI's migration documentation: [(link)](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/migration).
    - Types that were suffixed with `Options` have been changed, if their name would conflict with the options for a method. For example: `AssistantsThreadCreationOptions`, the main argument for `CreateThread()`, has been changed to `CreateThreadBody`.
