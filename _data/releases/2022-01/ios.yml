    #### Bugs fixed
    - Fix for when camera preview is rotating even if the app supports only portrait mode. [GH#338](https://github.com/Azure/Communication/issues/338)
    - Fix for the event `didUpdateRemoteParticipant` event not firing sometimes when `call.AddParticipant` API is called by the application.
    - Fix when the camera switch button is pressed several times, the preview of the client's camera can be blocked.
    - Fix for crash when signing out and signing in repeatedly.
    - `IncomingCall.accept` will now throw errors when trying to accept a terminated call or if already in an active call.

    #### Breaking Changes
    - `Call.addParticipant` API is now a throwable type when trying to add a participant that is already to the call or when a participant is added to an unconnected call.
    - `didChangeRecordingState` and `didChangeTranscriptionState` are moved out of `CallDelegate` into `RecordingFeatureDelegate` and into `TranscriptionFeatureDelegate`.
    **More documentation on extensions and the breaking change can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/voice-video-calling/calling-client-samples?pivots=platform-ios).**

    #### Features Added
    - Added support for specifying emergency country code when creating `CallAgent` by setting the property `emergencyCountryCode` in `CallAgentOptions`.
    - Join Teams calls either using a Teams meeting link or using Teams meeting coordinates.
    - `Recording` and `Transcription` features are decoupled from `Call` object and now can only be used via extensions.
    Usage example:
    ```
    let recordingFeature = self.call!.feature(RecordingFeature.self)
    recordingFeature.delegate = self.callObserver
    ```
