    #### Breaking Changes
    - Added the required parameter `buildMode` to `StartBuildModel` methods. Users must now choose the technique (`Template` or `Neural`) used to build models. For more information about the available build modes and their differences, see [here](https://aka.ms/azsdk/formrecognizer/buildmode).
    - Added the `tags` parameter to the `GetCopyAuthorization` methods.
    - Added the `tags` parameter to the `StartCreateComposedModel` methods.
    - The `DocumentAnalysisClient` and `DocumentModelAdministrationClient` now target the service version `2022-01-30-preview`, so they don't support `2021-09-30-preview` anymore.

    #### Features Added
    - Added the `DocumentField.AsCurrency` method and the `DocumentFieldType.Currency` enum value to support analyzed currency fields.
    - Added the `Languages` property to the `AnalyzeResult` class. This property is populated when using the `prebuilt-read` model and holds information about the languages in which the document is written.
    - Added the `Tags` property to the `BuildModelOptions` class. This property can be used to specify custom key-value attributes associated with the model to be built.
    - Added the `Tags` property to the `DocumentModelInfo` and to the `ModelOperationInfo` classes.
    - Added the `BuildMode` property to `DocTypeInfo` to indicate the technique used when building the correspoding model.
    - Added the `DocumentAnalysisModelFactory` static class to the `Azure.AI.FormRecognizer.DocumentAnalysis` namespace. It contains methods for instantiating `DocumentAnalysis` models for mocking.

    #### Bugs Fixed
    - FormRecognizerAudience and DocumentAnalysisAudience have been added to allow the user to select the Azure cloud where the resource is located. Issue [17192](https://github.com/azure/azure-sdk-for-net/issues/17192).

    #### Features Added
    - `EnvironmentCredential` now supports certificate subject name / issuer based authentication with `AZURE_CLIENT_SEND_CERTIFICATE_CHAIN` environment variable (A community contribution, courtesy of _[trevorlacey-msft](https://github.com/trevorlacey-msft))_.
    - `ManagedIdentityCredential` now supports accepting a `ResourceIdentifier` argument to specify a User Assigned Managed Identity by resource Id rather than client Id. `DefaultAzureCredential` also supports this via the `ManagedIdentityResourceId` property of `DefaultAzureCredentialOptions`.
    - Added `ClientAssertionCredential` for authenticating service principals with a presigned client assetion.

    #### Bugs Fixed
    - Fixed `AuthenticationFailedException` from `AzurePowerSheellCredential` when not logged in on non-windows platforms [#23498](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/issues/23498)
    - Fixed `ManagedIdentityCredential` response parsing to handle non-json responses [#24158](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/issues/24158)
