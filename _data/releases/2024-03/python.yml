    #### Breaking Changes

    - In the previous version, you would call the `analyze` method on the `ImageAnalysisClient` to analyze an image from a publicly accessible URL, or from a memory buffer. To better align with other Azure client libraires, this was changed in this release. Call the new dedicated `analyze_from_url` method to analyze an image from URL. Keep calling the `analyze` method to analyze an image from a memory buffer.
