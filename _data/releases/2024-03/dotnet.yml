    #### Features Added

    * Added Azure Container Apps resource detector.
    ([#41803](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/pull/41803))

    * Added `Azure.Monitor.OpenTelemetry.LiveMetrics`, enabling the sending of [live
    metrics
    data](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/live-stream).
    The newly added `EnableLiveMetrics` property is set to `true` by default. This
    property can be set to `false` to disable live metrics.
    ([#41872](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/pull/41872))

    - Added an experimental feature for logs emitted within an active tracing
    context to follow the Activity's sampling decision. The feature can be enabled
    by setting `OTEL_DOTNET_AZURE_MONITOR_EXPERIMENTAL_ENABLE_LOG_SAMPLING`
    environment variable to `true`.

  ChangelogContent: |-
    #### Features Added

    - Added a `CheckpointPosition` struct to `Azure.Messaging.EventHubs.Processor` to use when updating a checkpoint. The specified position indicates that an event processor should begin reading from the next event. Added new `UpdateCheckpointAsync` overloads to `CheckpointStore`, `PluggableCheckpointStoreEventProcessor<TPartition` and `EventProcessor<TPartition>` that accept the `CheckpointPosition` struct instead of individual values for offset and sequence number.

    #### Breaking Changes

    - The type of several existing values in the `EventData.SystemProperties` collection have been changed so that they are properly represented as .NET string types.  Previously, the underlying AMQP types were unintentionally returned, forcing callers to call `ToString()` to read the value.

    This is a behavioral breaking change that will impacts only those callers who were explicitly casting system property values to `AmqpAddress` or `AmqpMessageId` before calling `ToString()`.   The affected system properties are:
    - MessageId
    - CorrelationId
    - To
    - ReplyTo

    - The base implementations of both `UpdateCheckpointAsync` method overloads in `PluggableCheckpointStoreEventProcessor<TPartition>` and `EventProcessor<TPartition>` now choose sequence number over offset when writing a checkpoint and both values are provided. Previously, writing a checkpoint prioritized offset over sequence number.  There is no behavioral change for those using the official checkpoint store implementations.

    #### Bugs Fixed

    - Load balancing is no longer blocked when event processing for a lost partition does not honor the cancellation token.  Previously, long-running processing could cause delays in load balancing that resulted in ownership not being renewed for all partitions.

    - Adjusted retries to consider an unreachable host address as terminal.  Previously, all socket-based errors were considered transient and would be retried.

    - Fixed a race condition that could lead to a synchronization primitive being double-released if `IsRunning` was called concurrently while starting or stopping an event processor.

    - Fixed an issue with event processor validation where an exception for quota exceeded may inappropriately be surfaced when starting the processor.

    - In the rare case that an event processor's load balancing and health monitoring task cannot recover from an error, it will now properly surrender ownership when processing stops.

    - Reduced the timeout for transient service failures when starting the buffered producer. This ixed an issue where the buffered producer appeared to hang for an extended period of time when starting if it had issues querying Event Hub metadata for the first time.

    - Fixed the logic used to set the TimeToLive value of the AmqpMessageHeader for received messages to be based on the difference of the AbsoluteExpiryTime and CreationTime properties of the AmqpMessageProperties.

    #### Bugs Fixed

    - To
    - ReplyTo

Previously, writing a checkpoint prioritized offset over sequence number.  **There is no difference in behavior for normal usage scenarios.**

    #### Bugs Fixed

    - Fixed a race condition that could lead to a synchronization primitive being double-released if `IsRunning` was called concurrently while starting or stopping the processor.

    - Fixed a bug in which cancellation honored by the processor was interpreted as an error surfaced by developer code and a warning was inappropriately emitted to the error handler.

    - Fixed an issue with event processor validation where an exception for quota exceeded may inappropriately be surfaced when starting the processor.

    - In the rare case that an event processor's load balancing and health monitoring task cannot recover from an error, it will now properly surrender ownership when processing stops.

    #### Breaking Changes

    "On Your Data" changes:

    - Introduced a new type `AzureChatExtensionDataSourceResponseCitation` for a more structured representation of citation data.
    - Correspondingly, updated `AzureChatExtensionsMessageContext`:
    - Replaced `Messages` with `Citations` of type `AzureChatExtensionDataSourceResponseCitation`.
    - Added `Intent` as a string type.
    - Renamed "AzureCognitiveSearch" to "AzureSearch":
    - `AzureCognitiveSearchChatExtensionConfiguration` is now `AzureSearchChatExtensionConfiguration`.
    - `AzureCognitiveSearchIndexFieldMappingOptions` is now `AzureSearchIndexFieldMappingOptions`.
    - Check the project README for updated code snippets.

    #### Features Added

    - Text-to-speech using OpenAI TTS models is now supported. See [OpenAI's API reference](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/audio/createSpeech) or the [Azure OpenAI quickstart](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/text-to-speech-quickstart) for detailed overview and background information.
    - The new method `GenerateSpeechFromText` exposes this capability on `OpenAIClient`.
    - Text-to-speech converts text into lifelike spoken audio in a chosen voice, together with other optional configurations.
    - This method works for both Azure OpenAI and non-Azure `api.openai.com` client configurations

    #### Other Changes

    - Adjusted checkpointing logic to no longer write a checkpoint when the listener is shutting down.  This was necessary to prevent potential data loss from occurring when shutting down Function retries.  Because the trigger cannot know if the Function host would have retried a failure if it were not shutting down, we cannot assume that it is safe to checkpoint. This change ensures that the batch of events being processed when shut down was requested will be retried by another instance or the next time the Function app is run.

    - Updated the `Azure.Messaging.EventHubs`, which includes a new build of the AMQP transport library.  The notable bug fix addresses an obscure race condition when a cancellation token is signaled while service operations are being invoked concurrently which caused those operations to hang.
