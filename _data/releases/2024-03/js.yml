    #### Features Added

    Since 4.4.0:
    - Managed Identity can now be used in place of a SAS token to access the blob storage resource when performing backup and restore operations.

    #### Breaking Changes

    Since 4.5.0-beta.1:
    - Change signature of backup and restore operations to use an overload when using Managed Identity to access the blob storage resource. This means
    `undefined` no longer has to be passed in the `sasToken` parameter in order to set additional request options when using Managed Identity.
    This change is only breaking for customers using 4.5.0-beta.1 and does not impact customers using the previous GA version, 4.4.0.

    - Functions `getOperationState()`, `getResult()`, `isDone()` and `isStopped()` is changed to read-only attributes `operationState`, `result`, `isDone` and `isStopped`
    - Deprecated the attributes `requestMethod` and `requestPath` in `LongRunningOperation`
    - Added a new function `serialize` to help serialize the poller
    - Added a new function `submitted` to help wait for the poller submitted succesffully
    - Added a new parameter `TRequest` for `OperationResponse` to accept the raw request
    - Export the function `deserializeState` to the public
