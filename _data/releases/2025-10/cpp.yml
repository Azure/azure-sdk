    #### Breaking Changes

    - By default, `ManagedIdentityCredential` does not send a probe request, unless it is a part of credential chain in `DefaultAzureCredential`.

    #### Features Added

    - When `AZURE_TOKEN_CREDENTIALS` environment variable is configured to `ManagedIdentityCredential`, the `DefaultAzureCredential` does not issue a probe request and performs retries with exponential backoff.
