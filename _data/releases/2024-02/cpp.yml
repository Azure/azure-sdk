    #### Bugs Fixed

    - Fixed uAMQP connection channel so that a channel is released when an END performative is received from the remote node instead of when the END performative is sent to the remote node.
    - Enabled more than one uAMQP session to be created on a single connection.

    #### Features Added

    - The `Close` method on AMQP Message Sender and Message Receiver now blocks until the client receives a `DETACH` response from the remote node.

    #### Breaking Changes

    - The `Close` method on AMQP Message Sender and Message Receiver now accepts an `Azure::Core::Context` parameter. This parameter is defaulted so this change should not affect existing code.
