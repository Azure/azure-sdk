  VersionType: Beta

  ChangelogContent: |-
    #### Breaking Changes

    - Removed `numpy` dependency. All NaN values returned by the SDK have been changed to from `numpy.nan` to `math.nan`.
    - `credential` is now required to be passed in for all content safety evaluators and `ProtectedMaterialsEvaluator`. `DefaultAzureCredential` will no longer be chosen if a credential is not passed.
    - Changed package extra name from "pf-azure" to "remote".

    #### Bugs Fixed
    - Adversarial Conversation simulations would fail with `Forbidden`. Added logic to re-fetch token in the exponential retry logic to retrive RAI Service response.

    #### Features Added

    * Support for OpenTelemetry tracing. Please find more information in the package [README.md](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/ai/azure-ai-inference/README.md).
    * When constructing clients using input `credential` of type `AzureKeyCredential`, two HTTP request headers are sent simultaneously for authentication: `Authentication: Beater <key>` and `api-key: <key>` (previously only the first one was sent). This is to support different inference services, removing the need for the application to explicitly specify an additional HTTP request header.
