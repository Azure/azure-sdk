    #### Bugs Fixed

    - Added `pushChannelExpired` and `pushVariables` to the `Installation` type.
    - [#30439](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/issues/30439)

    #### Breaking Changes

    - Moving from `@azure/core-lro` v2 to v3 for long running operations.  For APIs such as `beginSubmitNotificationHubJob`, this is a breaking change as it uses the new `PollerLike` interface instead of the old `SimplePollerLike` interface.  See the [Polling API](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/main/sdk/core/core-lro/docs/MIGRATION.md#poller-api) migration guide for more information.
    - Sending broadcast notifications are now separated into `sendBroadcastNotification` for immediate sends and `scheduleBroadcastNotification` for scheduled sends.  The `sendNotification` method now only supports direct sends and tag based sends, and the `scheduleNotification` method now only supports scheduled tag based sends.

    #### Features Added

    - Added `scheduledBroadcastNotification` to send a scheduled broadcast notification.
    - Added `sendBroadcastNotification` to send a broadcast notification.
    - Moved to `@azure/core-lro` v3 for long running operations.
