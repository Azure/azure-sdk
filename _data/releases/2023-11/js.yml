    #### Bugs Fixed
    - Ensure `AzurePowershellCredential` calls PowerShell with the `-NoProfile`  and "-NonInteractive" flag to avoid loading user profiles for more consistent behavior. ([#27023](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/pull/27023))
    - Fixed browser bundling for Azure Developer CLI credential. ([Identity] update mapping for browser for azd (#27097))
    - `ManagedIdentityCredential` will fall through to the next credential in the chain in the case that Docker Desktop returns a 403 response when attempting to access the IMDS endpoint.([#27050](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/pull/27050)).
