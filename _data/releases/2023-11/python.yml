  ChangelogContent: |-
    #### Bugs Fixed
    - Deprecated `BlobProperties` as a valid input type to the `blob` parameter on the following APIs:
    BlobServiceClient's `get_blob_client`, ContainerClient's `delete_blob`, `download_blob`, and `get_blob_client`.
    This deprecation change also applies to the `name` parameter on ContainerClient's `upload_blob` API. This change
    applies to both sync and async packages but does not apply to the batch equivalent of any of the listed APIs. If a
    `BlobProperties` is provided, a deprecation warning is raised.

    #### Features Added
    - Added support for service version 2023-11-03.
    - Added `audience` as an optional keyword that can be specified on APIs that have a `credential` parameter. This
    keyword only has an effect when the credential provided is of type `TokenCredential`.
