    #### Features Added

    - Added `CodeTransparencyRedirectPolicy` to automatically follow HTTP 307/308 redirects while preserving the Authorization header. Previously, redirects between Confidential Ledger nodes could return HTTP 307/308 responses that were not automatically followed by the default pipeline, causing these requests to fail unless clients implemented redirect handling themselves.

  ChangelogContent: |-
    #### Features Added

    - Added `ConfidentialLedgerRedirectPolicy` to automatically follow HTTP 307/308 redirects while preserving the Authorization header. Previously, the SDK did not follow redirects by default, and even when redirects were enabled, the Authorization header was stripped on cross-domain redirects between ACL nodes, causing write operations to fail when routed to non-primary nodes.
