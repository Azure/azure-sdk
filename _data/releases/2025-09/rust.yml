    #### Features Added

    - Added `Bytes` (moved from `typespec_client_core`).
    - Added `HeaderName::is_standard()`.
    - Added `json` module if the `json` feature is enabled (moved from `typespec_client_core`).
    - Added `RawResponse` to `ErrorKind::HttpResponse` that contains the HTTP status code, headers, and complete error response body.
    - Added `xml` feature.
    - Added `xml` module if the `xml` feature is enabled (moved from `typespec_client_core`).

    #### Breaking Changes

    - Added a lifetime parameter to `TokenRequestOptions`.
    - Added the ability to configure pipeline configuration independently from `ClientOptions`. This adds a new optional `PipelineOptions` parameter to `azure_core::http::Pipeline::new()`. If not specified, it defaults to the expected options for `azure_core` services.
    - Changed `FromStr for RequestContent<T, F>` to `RequestContent::from_str()`.
    - Changed `TryFrom<&'static str> for RequestContent<T, F>` to `RequestContent::from_static()`.
    - Changed `TryFrom<Bytes> for RequestContent<T, F>` to `From<Bytes> for RequestContent<T, F>` because it was already infallible.
    - Removed `TryFrom<Vec<u8>> for RequestContent<T, F>` since `RequestContent::from()` already exists.
    - Removed feature `reqwest_rustls_tls`. See [README.md](https://github.com/heaths/azure-sdk-for-rust/blob/main/sdk/core/azure_core/README.md) for alternative HTTP client configuration.
    - Removed the `fs` module including the `FileStream` and `FileStreamBuilder` types. Moved to `examples/` for `typespec_client_core` to copy if needed.
    - Removed the `setters` macro.
    - Renamed `RawResponse` to `BufResponse`. New `RawResponse` contains complete body as `Bytes` used in `ErrorKind::HttpResponse`.

    #### Features Added

    - Added `RawResponse` to `ErrorKind::HttpResponse` that contains the HTTP status code, headers, and complete error response body.
    - Added `RequestContent::from_slice()`.
    - Added `TokenRequestOptions { method_options: ClientMethodOptions }`.
    - Added `TryFrom<T> for RequestContent<T, JsonFormat>` for JSON primitives.
    - Added support for WASM to the `async_runtime` module.
    - Added logging policy to log HTTP requests and responses in the pipeline. As a part of this change, sanitization support was added to places which log HTTP headers and URLs. The `azure_core::http::ClientOptions` has been enhanced with a `LoggingOptions` which allows a user/service client to specify headers or URL query parameters which should be allowed. Note that the sanitization feature is disabled if you build with the `debug` feature enabled.
    - Added support for a new `azure_core::error::http::ErrorResponse` structure which describes an error according to the Azure REST API guidelines.
    - Added a new `azure_core::http::check_success(BufResponse)` function to convert a buffered response to an `ErrorKind::HttpResponse`.

    #### Breaking Changes

    - Added pipeline configuration options (`PipelineOptions`) to `typespec_client_core::http::Pipeline::new()` to enable customization of the options for an HTTP pipeline.
    - Changed `FromStr for RequestContent<T, F>` to `RequestContent::from_str()`.
    - Changed `TryFrom<&'static str> for RequestContent<T, F>` to `RequestContent::from_static()`.
    - Changed `TryFrom<Bytes> for RequestContent<T, F>` to `From<Bytes> for RequestContent<T, F>` because it was already infallible.

    - Removed the `setters` macro.
    - Removed the cloud service specific retry headers from typespec_client_core.
    - Renamed `RawResponse` to `BufResponse`. New `RawResponse` contains complete body as `Bytes` used in `ErrorKind::HttpResponse`.
    - Removed HttpError type from typespec_client_core because it is an azure_core construct.

    #### Features Added

    - Added `RequestContent::from_slice()`.
    - Added `TryFrom<T> for RequestContent<T, JsonFormat>` for JSON primitives.
    - Added support for WASM to the `async_runtime` module.

    #### Breaking Changes

    - `ProducerClient::send_batch` now consumes its `batch` argument.

    #### Features Added

    - Reconnect support for EventHubs operations.
    - Enable [Geo Replication](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/event-hubs/geo-replication) support in Event Hubs consumers and producers.
