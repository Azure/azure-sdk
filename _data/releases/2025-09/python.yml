    #### Bugs Fixed
    * Fixed session container session token logic. The SDK will now only send the relevant partition-local session tokens for read document requests and write requests when multi-region writes are enabled, as opposed to the entire compound session token for the container for every document request. See [PR 41678](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/pull/41678).
    * Write requests for single-write region accounts will no longer send session tokens when using session consistency. See [PR 41678](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/pull/41678).
    * Fixed bug where container cache was not being properly updated resulting in unnecessary extra requests. See [PR 42143](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/pull/42143).
    * Fixed bug where the Filters on Parent loggers or handlers of Cosmos Diagnostics loggers were not being applied. See [PR 41012](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/pull/41012)

    #### Features Added
    * Added feed range support in `query_items`. See [PR 41722](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/pull/41722).
