    #### Breaking Changes

    - Removed WorkspaceHubConfig entity, and renamed WorkspaceHub to Hub.
    - workspace_hub input of Workspace class hidden, renamed to hub_id, and re-surfaced in child class Project.
    - Removed Workspace Hub Operations from ML Client.

    #### Features Added
    - Add experimental support for working with Promptflow evaluators: `ml_client.evaluators`.
    - Many changes to the Connection entity class and its associated operations.
    - Workspace Connection `list`, `get`, and `create_or_update` operations now include an optional `populate_secrets` input, which causes the operations to try making a secondary call to fill in the returned connections' credential info if possible. Only works with api key-based credentials for now.
    - Many workspace connection subtypes added. The full list of subclasses is now:
    - `AzureBlobStoreConnection`
    - `AzureBlobStoreConnection`
    - `MicrosoftOneLakeConnection`
    - `AzureOpenAIConnection`
    - `AzureAIServicesConnection`
    - `AzureAISearchConnection`
    - `AzureContentSafetyConnection`
    - `AzureSpeechServicesConnection`
    - `APIKeyConnection`
    - `OpenAIConnection`
    - `SerpConnection`
    - `ServerlessConnection`
    - Many workspace connections only accept api keys or entra ids for credentials. Since Entra IDs require not inputs, these have been refactored to not required a full credential object. Instead they only accept an api_key as a top-level input, and default to an entra credential otherwise. Their YAML schemas have been similarly altered.
    - Client-side credential-type validation added for some workspace connection types.
    - Added new credential type: `AadCredentialConfiguration`
    - Renamed WorkspaceHub class as Hub.
    - Added Project entity class and YAML support.
    - Project and Hub operations supported by workspace operations.
    - workspace list operation supports type filtering.
    - Add support for Microsoft Entra token (`aad_token`) auth in `invoke` and `get-credentials` operations.
    - Add experimental support for working with indexes: `ml_client.indexes`
