    #### New Features

    - Added support for local cryptography operations. If supported by the key type and algorithm, the `CryptographyClient` will attempt to perform a cryptography operation locally.
    - Added support for symmetric keys in Managed HSMs including support for AES encryption algorithms to encrypt, decrypt, wrap, and unwrap using symmetric keys.
    - Added support for the 7.2 version of the Key Vault service API.

    #### Bug Fixes

    - Fixed a bug with `beginDeleteKey` and `beginRecoverDeletedKey` in which unknown service errors wouldn't bubble up properly to the end users.
    - Fixed bug with the list operations which were returning misplaced properties. Fixes customer issue: [15353](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/issues/15353).
    - Fixed an issue where retrying a failed initial Key Vault request may result in an empty body.

    #### Changes since 4.2.0-beta.5:

    - Removed the now obsolete `KeyOperationsOptions` and replaced it with `CryptographyOptions`.
    - Introduced in 4.2.0-beta.1 to support additional encryption parameters for AES encryption, we have since moved these parameters outside of the options bag so a separate `KeyOperationsOptions` is now redundant.
    - Fixed a bug with `beginDeleteKey` and `beginRecoverDeletedKey` in which unknown service errors wouldn't bubble up properly to the end users.
    - Fixed bug with the list operations which were returning misplaced properties. Fixes customer issue: [15353](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/issues/15353).
    - Exported a method to parse Key Vault Key Ids: `parseKeyVaultKeyIdentifier`.
