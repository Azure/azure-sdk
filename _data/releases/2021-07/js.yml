    #### New features

    - This release marks the initial beta availability of the `@azure/identity-vscode` package. This package extends `@azure/identity` by providing the dependencies of `VisualStudioCodeCredential` and enabling it within the `@azure/identity` package. `VisualStudioCodeCredential` uses the authenticated session from the "Azure Account" extension in Visual Studio Code. If this extension package is not loaded using `useIdentityExtension`, then `VisualStudioCodeCredential` from `@azure/identity` will throw a `CredentialUnavailableError`. By enabling `VisualStudioCodeCredential`, the `DefaultAzureCredential` class in `@azure/identity` also gains functionality allowing it to use the "Azure Account" session if it is available.

  ChangelogContent: |-
    #### New features

    - This release marks the initial beta availability of the `@azure/identity-cache-persistence` package. This package provides an extension to `@azure/identity` that enables persistent token caching in a secure storage defined by the Operating System (caching of token values across sessions), which allows skipping interactive authentication flows if a previously-cached token is still available. This is implemented using the following technologies:
    - On Windows, the cache will use a DPAPI-protected file.
    - On macOS, the cache will use the macOS Keychain.
    - On Linux, the cache will use `libsecret` to store the tokens (this will use a provider backend, e.g. GNOME Keyring).
    - On Linux and macOS, the cache may optionally use an unencrypted file as a last resort, but only if the `allowUnencryptedStorage` property is set to true in the `tokenCachePersistenceOptions` passed to the credential constructor.

    #### Breaking Changes

    - Removed the protected method `getAzureCliAccessToken` from the public API of the `AzureCliCredential`. While it will continue to be available as part of v1, we won't be supporting this method as part of v2's public API.

    #### Features Added
    - With the dropping of support for Node.js versions that are no longer in LTS, the dependency on `@types/node` has been updated to version 12. Read our [support policy](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/main/SUPPORT.md) for more details.
    - Introduced an extension API through a top-level method `useIdentityExtension`. The function accepts an "extension" as an argument, which is a function accepting a `context`. The extension context is an internal part of the Azure Identity API, so it has an `unknown` type. Two new packages are designed to be used with this API:
    - `@azure/identity-vscode`, which provides the dependencies of `VisualStudioCodeCredential` and enables it (see more below).
    - `@azure/identity-cache-persistence`, which provides persistent token caching (same as was available in version 2.0.0-beta.2, but now provided through a secondary extension package).
    - Reintroduced a stub implementation of `VisualStudioCodeCredential`. If the `@azure/identity-vscode` extension is not used, then it will throw a `CredentialUnavailableError` (similar to how it previously behaved if the `keytar` package was not installed). The extension now provides the underlying implementation of `VisualStudioCodeCredential` through dependency injection.
    - Reintroduced the `TokenCachePersistenceOptions` property on most credential constructor options. This property must be present with an `enabled` property set to true to enable persistent token caching for a credential instance. Credentials that do not support persistent token caching do not have this property.
    - Added support to `ManagedIdentityCredential` for Bridge to Kubernetes local development authentication.
    - Enabled PKCE on `InteractiveBrowserCredential` for Node.js. [Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7636) is a security feature that mitigates authentication code interception attacks.
    - Added `LoginHint` property to `InteractiveBrowserCredentialOptions` which allows a user name to be pre-selected for interactive logins. Setting this option skips the account selection prompt and immediately attempts to login with the specified account.
    - Added regional STS support to client credential types.
    - Added the `RegionalAuthority` type, that allows specifying Azure regions.
    - Added `regionalAuthority` property to `ClientSecretCredentialOptions` and `ClientCertificateCredentialOptions`.
    - If instead of a region, `AutoDiscoverRegion` is specified as the value for `regionalAuthority`, MSAL will be used to attempt to discover the region.
    - A region can also be specified through the `AZURE_REGIONAL_AUTHORITY_NAME` environment variable.
    - `AzureCliCredential` and `AzurePowerShellCredential` now allow specifying a `tenantId`.
    - All credentials except `ManagedIdentityCredential` support enabling multi tenant authentication via the `allowMultiTenantAuthentication` option.

    #### Key Bugs Fixed

    - Fixed an issue in which `InteractiveBrowserCredential` on Node would sometimes cause the process to hang if there was no browser available.
    - Fixed an issue in which the `AZURE_AUTHORITY_HOST` environment variable was not properly picked up in NodeJS.
