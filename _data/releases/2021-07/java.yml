  ChangelogContent: |-
    #### Features Added
    - Changed default service version to `7.2`.
    - Added `KeyVaultCertificateIdentifier` to parse certificate URLs.

    #### Changes since 4.2.0-beta.6

    ##### Bug Fixes
    - Ensured that `RetryPolicy` and `HttpLogOptions` use a default implementation when creating Key Vault clients if not set or set to `null`.

    ##### New Features
    - `KeyVaultCertificateIdentifier` can now be used to parse any Key Vault identifier.

    ##### Breaking Changes
    - Removed service method overloads that take a `pollingInterval`, since `PollerFlux` and `SyncPoller` objects allow for setting this value directly on them.

    ##### Non-Breaking Changes
    - Renamed `certificateId` to `sourceId` in `KeyVaultCertificateIdentifier`.
    - Added the `@ServiceMethod` annotation to all public methods that call the Key Vault service in `CertificateClient` and `CertificateAsyncClient`.

    - Made all getters for properties of a `JsonWebKey` public.

    #### Changes since 4.3.0-beta.8

    ##### Bug Fixes
    - Ensured that `RetryPolicy` and `HttpLogOptions` use a default implementation when creating Key Vault clients if not set or set to `null`.

    ##### New Features

    * Fixed an issue on handling partition splits during bulk operations in Gateway Mode.
    * Fixed an issue with `NumberFormatException` happening on requests on large containers.
    * Fixed an issue with BackOff time in `ThroughputController`.

  ChangelogContent: |-
    #### Bug fixes
    - Fixed issue where clients builders would not throw when calling `buildClient()` or `buildAsyncClient()` if no `endpoint` had been set.
    - Fixed issue where `TableClient`'s and `TableClientAsync`'s `submitTransaction()` and `submitTransactionWithResponse()` could not be called from inside a Reactor thread (e.g. calling it inside a chain of reactive operations, such as `myOtherOperation.then(result -> client.submitTransaction(transactionActions)`).
    - Fixed issue that would make an exception be raised when calling `submitTransaction()` if Java's SecurityManager was enabled and no `ReflectPermission` had been granted.

    #### New Features

    - Introduced the following classes:
    - `TableAccessPolicies`
    - `TableTransactionAction`
    - `TableTransactionActionType`
    - `TableTransactionFailedException`
    - `TableTransactionResult`
    - Added support for generating SAS tokens at the Account and Table Service level in all clients. Introduced the following related classes:
    - `TableAccountSasPermission`
    - `TableAccountSasResourceType`
    - `TableAccountSasService`
    - `TableAccountSasSignatureValues`
    - `TableSasIpRange`
    - `TableSasPermission`
    - `TableSasSignatureValues`
    - Added the following methods to `TableClient`, `TableAsyncClient`:
    - `listAccessPolicies()`
    - `setAccessPolicies()`
    - `setAccessPoliciesWithResponse()`
    - `generateSasToken()`
    - Added the following methods to `TableServiceClient`, `TableServiceAsyncClient`:
    - `getProperties()`
    - `getPropertiesWithResponse()`
    - `setProperties()`
    - `setPropertiesWithResponse()`
    - `getStatistics()`
    - `getStatisticsWithResponse()`
    - `generateAccountSasToken()`

    #### Breaking Changes

    - Removed the `TableBatch` and `TableAsyncBatch` types, as well as the methods `TableAsyncClient.createBatch()` and `TableClient.createBatch()`. In their place, batch operations can now be submitted via the following methods:
    - `TableAsyncClient.submitTransaction(List<TableTransactionAction> transactionalBatch)`
    - `TableAsyncClient.submitTransactionWithResponse(List<TableTransactionAction> transactionalBatch)`
    - `TableClient.submitTransaction(List<TableTransactionAction> transactionalBatch)`
    - `TableClient.submitTransactionWithResponse(List<TableTransactionAction> transactionalBatch, Duration timeout, Context context)`
    - Renamed `BatchOperationResponse` to `TableTransactionActionResponse`
    - `deleteEntity()` variants in `TableClient` and `TableAsyncClient` now accept an `ifUnchanged` flag instead of an `eTag` parameter for conditional operations. When said flag is set to `true`, the ETag of a given `TableEntity` will be matched with the ETag of the entity in the Table service.
    - Replaced `deleteEntityWithResponse(String partitionKey, String rowKey, String eTag)` with `deleteEntityWithResponse(TableEntity entity, boolean ifUnchanged)` in `TableAsyncClient`.
    - Replaced `deleteEntityWithResponse(String partitionKey, String rowKey, String eTag, Duration timeout, Context context)` with `deleteEntityWithResponse(TableEntity entity, boolean ifUnchanged, Duration timeout, Context context)` in `TableClient`.
    - Removed remaining public APIs supporting the use of `TableEntity` subclasses from `TableAsyncClient`.
    - Removed the following method overloads from `TableClient` and `TableAsyncClient`:
    - `upsertEntity(TableEntity entity, TableEntityUpdateMode updateMode)`
    - `updateEntity(TableEntity entity, TableEntityUpdateMode updateMode,
    boolean ifUnchanged)`
    - `getEntity(String partitionKey, String rowKey, List<String> select)`
    - Client builders now also throw an `IllegalStateException` when calling `buildClient()` and `buildAsyncClient()` if multiple forms of authentication are provided, with the exception of `sasToken` + `connectionString`; or if `endpoint` and/or `sasToken` are set alongside a `connectionString` and the endpoint and/or SAS token in the latter are different than the former, respectively.
    - The following methods and their `WithResponse` variants in `TableClient` and `TableAsyncClient` now throw an `IllegalArgumentException` instead of an `IllegalStateException` when an empty `TableEntity` is provided:
    - `createEntity()`
    - `upsertEntity()`
    - `updateEntity()`
    - `deleteEntity()`

    #### Changes since 4.0.0-beta.7

    ##### Bug Fixes
    - Ensured that `RetryPolicy` and `HttpLogOptions` use a default implementation when creating Key Vault clients if not set or set to `null`.

    ##### Breaking Changes
    - Renamed `beginSelectiveRestore()` to `beginSelectiveKeyRestore()` in `KeyVaultBackupClient` and `KeyVaultBackupAsyncClient`. Made the aforementioned operation return the new `KeyVaultSelectiveKeyRestoreOperation` instead of a `KeyVaultRestoreOperation`.
    - Changed the final return type of `beginRestore()` and `beginSelectiveKeyRestore()`'s poller types from `Void` to the new `KeyVaultRestoreResult` and `KeyVaultSelectiveKeyRestoreResult`, respectively.
    - `KeyVaultBackupClient` and `KeyVaultBackupAsyncClient`'s long-running operations now throw a `RuntimeException` when cancellation is attempted, as it is not currently supported.
    - Made `KeyVaultRoleDefinition` flat, as opposed to it having a `KeyVaultRoleDefinitionProperties` member with more properties inside of it.
    - Moved `roleScope` from `KeyVaultRoleAssignment` to `KeyVaultRoleAssignmentProperties` and renamed it to `scope`.
    - Moved `SetRoleDefinitionOptions` from the `options` package to the `models` package.
    - Removed `roleType` from `SetRoleDefinitionOptions`.
    - Removed service method overloads that take a `pollingInterval`, since `PollerFlux` and `SyncPoller` objects allow for setting this value directly on them.
    - Delete methods on the `KeyVaultAccessControlClient` now return a `void` or `Mono<Void>` and ignore HTTP `404`s.
    - Renamed `jobId` and `getJobId()` to `operationId` and `getOperationId()` in `KeyVaultLongRunningOperation` and its children classes.
    - Made the following classes `final`:
    - `KeyVaultDataAction`
    - `KeyVaultRoleDefinitionType`
    - `KeyVaultRoleType`
    - `SetRoleDefinitionOptions`

    #### Breaking Changes
    - Changed behavior in `beginAnalyzeActions` API where now accepts up to one action only per action type.
    An `IllegalArgumentException` is raised if multiple actions of the same type are passed.
    - Replaced
    `AnalyzeActionsResultPagedFlux` to `PagedFlux<AnalyzeActionsResult>`,
    `AnalyzeActionsResultPagedIterable` to `PagedIterable<AnalyzeActionsResult>`,
    `AnalyzeHealthcareEntitiesPagedFlux` to `PagedFlux<AnalyzeHealthcareEntitiesResultCollection>`,
    `AnalyzeHealthcareEntitiesPagedIterable` to `PagedIterable<AnalyzeHealthcareEntitiesResultCollection>`.
    - Deprecated `analyzeSentimentBatch***` APIs with type `TextAnalyticsRequestOptions` option bag below. The same
    functionalities can be done in the APIs with `AnalyzeSentimentOptions` instead:
    `AnalyzeSentimentResultCollection analyzeSentimentBatch(Iterable<String> documents, String language, TextAnalyticsRequestOptions options)`,
    `Response<AnalyzeSentimentResultCollection> analyzeSentimentBatchWithResponse(Iterable<TextDocumentInput> documents, TextAnalyticsRequestOptions options, Context context)`,
    `Mono<Response<AnalyzeSentimentResultCollection>> analyzeSentimentBatchWithResponse(Iterable<TextDocumentInput> documents, TextAnalyticsRequestOptions options)`,
    `Mono<AnalyzeSentimentResultCollection> analyzeSentimentBatch(Iterable<String> documents, String language, TextAnalyticsRequestOptions options)`
    - Removed `StringIndexType`. This SDK will keep using UTF-16 code unit as the default encoding.
    - Removed type `ExtractKeyPhrasesOptions`, `RecognizeEntitiesOptions`, `RecognizeLinkedEntitiesOptions` and respective exposures.
    - Removed the property `statistics` from `AnalyzeActionsResult` as it is not currently returned by the service even if
    the user passes `includeStatistics` = `true`.
    - Removed constructors, but to use the private setter accessor to assign the additional properties:
    `CategorizedEntity(String text, EntityCategory category, String subcategory, double confidenceScore, int offset)`,
    `LinkedEntity(String name, IterableStream<LinkedEntityMatch> matches, String languages, String dataSourceEntityId, String url, String dataSource, String bingEntitySearchApiId)`,
    `LinkedEntityMatch(String text, double confidenceScore, int offset)`
    - Renamed type `PiiEntityDomainType` to `PiiEntityDomain`.
    - Renamed `AnalyzeActionResult`'s property `recognizeEntitiesActionResults` to `recognizeEntitiesResults` which dropped the keyword `Action`.
    This change applied to all the other `***ActionResults` properties as well.
    - Renamed property name `result` to `documentsResults` in `AnalyzeSentimentActionResult`, `ExtractKeyPhrasesActionResult`,
    `RecognizeEntitiesActionResult`, `RecognizeLinkedEntitiesActionResult`, and `RecognizePiiEntitiesActionResult`.
    - Renamed the enum values in `PiiEntityCategory` by separating words with the underscore character.
    - Renamed the methods in `AnalyzeActionsOperationDetail`,
    `getActionsFailed()` to `getFailedCount()`,
    `getActionsInProgress()` to `getInProgressCount()`,
    `getActionsInTotal()` to `getTotalCount()`,
    `getActionsSucceeded()` to `getSucceededCount()`.
    - `TextAnalyticsActions` now takes `***Action` types, instead of `***Options` types. Renamed The getter and setter method names
    based on the new type names. Replacing types show as follows:
    - `ExtractKeyPhrasesOption` changed to new type `ExtractKeyPhrasesAction`.
    - `RecognizeEntitiesOption` changed to new type `RecognizeEntitiesAction`.
    - `RecognizePiiEntitiesOption` changed to new type `RecognizePiiEntitiesAction`.
    - `RecognizeLinkedEntitiesOption` changed to new type `RecognizeLinkedEntitiesAction`.
    - `AnalyzeSentimentOption` changed to new type `AnalyzeSentimentAction`.
