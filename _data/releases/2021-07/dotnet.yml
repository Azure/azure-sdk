    #### Features Added

    - `EventData` now exposes the full AMQP message via the `GetRawAmqpMessage` method.  _(Based on a community prototype contribution, courtesy of [danielmarbach](https://github.com/danielmarbach))_

    - `EventData` now supports construction using a `string` to specify the event body; this will be represented as a set of UTF-8 encoded bytes for transport.

    - `EventData` has been extended to include properties for applications to assign a `MessageId`, `ContentType`, and `CorrelationId` as well-known members.  It is important to note that these properties are intended for application use and are not recognized by the Event Hubs service.

    -  When stopping, the `EventProcessor<TPartition>` will now attempt to force-close connections blocked on their timeout.  This should significantly help reduce the amount of time the processor takes to stop in many scenarios. _(Based on a community prototype contribution, courtesy of [danielmarbach](https://github.com/danielmarbach))_

    #### Key Bugs Fixed

    - The `EventProcessor<TPartition>` will now properly respect another another consumer stealing ownership of a partition when the service forcibly terminates the active link in the background.  Previously, the client did not observe the error directly and attempted to recover the faulted link which reasserted ownership and caused the partition to "bounce" between owners until a load balancing cycle completed.

    - The `EventHubConsumerClient` and `PartitionReceiver` will now properly surface an exception when another another consumer stealing ownership of a partition when the service forcibly terminates the active link in the background.  Previously, the client did not observe the error directly and did not make callers attempted to recover the faulted link which reasserted ownership and caused the partition to "bounce" between owners until a load balancing cycle completed.

  ChangelogContent: |-
    #### Features Added
     - Added support for service version `3.0`. This can be specified in the `TextAnalyticsClientOptions` object under the `ServiceVersion` enum. By default the SDK targets latest supported service version.
     - Added AAD support for the `StartAnalyzeHealthcareEntities` methods.
     - Added value `None` to enum `PiiEntityDomainType` to allow user to specify no domain.
     - Added new overload methods to all `xxActions` types that take a `xxOptions` object to facilitate a transition from a singular method to an actions method.
     - The parameter `CategoriesFilter` in `RecognizePiiEntitiesActions` has been enabled for `StartAnalyzeActions` methods.
     #### Breaking changes
     - Changed behavior in `StartAnalyzeActions` and `StartAnalyzeActionsAsync` where now accepts a single action per action type. An `ArgumentException` is raised if duplicate actions are passed.
     - Changed type `RecognizePiiEntitiesOptions.DomainFilter` from `PiiEntityDomainType?` to `PiiEntityDomainType`.
     - Changed type `AnalyzeActionsOptions.IncludeStatistics` from `bool` to `bool?`.
     - Renamed `StartAnalyzeBatchActions` to `StartAnalyzeActions`.
     - Renamed `AnalyzeBatchActionsOperation` to `AnalyzeActionsOperation`.
     - Renamed `AnalyzeBatchActionsResult` to `AnalyzeActionsResult`.
     - Renamed `AnalyzeBatchActionsOptions` to `AnalyzeActionsOptions`.
     - `TextAnalyticsActions` now takes `xxAction` types, instead of `xxOptions` types. Renames and types are as follow:
     - `ExtractKeyPhrasesOptions` changed to new type `ExtractKeyPhrasesActions`.
     - `RecognizeEntitiesOptions` changed to new type `RecognizeEntitiesActions`.
     - `RecognizePiiEntitiesOptions` changed to new type `RecognizePiiEntitiesActions`.
     - `RecognizeLinkedEntitiesOptions` changed to new type `RecognizeLinkedEntitiesActions`.
     - `AnalyzeSentimentOptions` changed to new type `AnalyzeSentimentActions`.
     - Renamed type `TextAnalyticsActionDetails` to `TextAnalyticsActionResult`.
     - Renamed type `PiiEntityDomainType` to `PiiEntityDomain`.
     - Renamed type `Results` to `DocumentsResults` in `AnalyzeSentimentActionResult`, `ExtractKeyPhrasesActionResult`, `RecognizeEntitiesActionResult`, `RecognizeLinkedEntitiesActionResult`, and `RecognizePiiEntitiesActionResult`.
     - Renamed all types under `AnalyzeActionsResult` from `xxActionsResults` to ``xxResults`.
     - Removed property `Statistics` from `AnalyzeActionsResult` as it is not currently returned by the service even if the user passes `IncludeStatistics  = true`.
     - Removed property `StringIndexType` from `TextAnalyticsRequestOptions`. This SDK will keep using `UTF-16` code unit as the default encoding.
     - Removed type `ExtractKeyPhrasesOptions` and respective exposure.
     - Removed type `RecognizeEntitiesOptions` and respective exposure.
     - Removed type `RecognizeLinkedEntitiesOptions` and respective exposure.

    #### Features Added

This should significantly help reduce the amount of time the processor takes to stop in many scenarios. _(Based on a community prototype contribution, courtesy of [danielmarbach](https://github.com/danielmarbach))_

    - When the `EventProcessorClient` detects a partition being stolen outside of a load balancing cycle, it will immediately surrender ownership rather than waiting for a load balancing cycle to confirm the ownership change.  This will help reduce event duplication from overlapping ownership of processors.

    #### Key Bugs Fixed

    - The `EventProcessorClient` will now properly respect another another consumer stealing ownership of a partition when the service forcibly terminates the active link in the background.  Previously, the client did not observe the error directly and attempted to recover the faulted link which reasserted ownership and caused the partition to "bounce" between owners until a load balancing cycle completed.

    #### Features Added
    - `DimensionKey` now implements the `IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<string, string>>` interface. Dimension columns can now be enumerated.
    - Added method `Contains` to `DimensionKey` to check whether or not a dimension column is present.
    - Added property `DimensionsToSplitAlert` to `AnomalyAlertConfiguration` to allow splitting an alert into multiple ones.
    - Added property `MeasureType` to `MetricBoundaryCondition` to control which measure should be used when checking boundaries for alert triggering. Current supported types are `Value` and `Mean`.
    - `NotificationHook.Administrators` is now a `IList` (not read-only anymore), and can be used to update the list of administrators or set it during creation.

    #### Breaking Changes
    - Removed methods `AddDimensionColumn` and `RemoveDimensionColumn` from `DimensionKey`. In order to access elements, the new method `TryGetValue` must be used. Once the instance has been created, the columns can't be modified anymore.
    - `DimensionKey` constructor now takes the required `dimensions` parameter.
    - The whole `DatasourceCredential` API has been renamed to `DataSourceCredential`. This includes renames in methods, method parameters, and properties.
    - Split the method `GetAnomalies` into two different methods: `GetAnomaliesForAlert` and `GetAnomaliesForDetectionConfiguration`.
    - Split the method `GetIncidents` into two different methods: `GetIncidentsForAlert` and `GetIncidentsForDetectionConfiguration`.
    - `DataFeedIngestionSettings` constructor now takes the required `ingestionStartsOn` parameter. For this reason, the property `IngestionStartTime`, now named `IngestionStartsOn`, is not nullable anymore.
    - `EmailNotificationHook` constructor now takes the required `name` parameter.
    - `WebNotificationHook` constructor now takes the required `name` and `endpoint` parameters.
    - `MetricSeriesGroupDetectionCondition` constructor now takes the required `seriesGroupKey` parameter.
    - `MetricSingleSeriesDetectionCondition` constructor now takes the required `seriesKey` parameter.
    - In `MetricSeriesData`, removed the `Definition` property. Now, properties `MetricId` and `SeriesKey` can be accessed directly from `MetricSeriesData`.
    - In `MetricAnomalyAlertScope`, renamed static methods `GetScopeFor<...>` to `CreateScopeFor<...>`. For instance, `GetScopeForSeriesGroup` was renamed to `CreateScopeForSeriesGroup`.
    - Changed order of parameters of `MetricsAdvisorClient.GetMetricEnrichedSeriesData`. Now, `detectionConfigurationId` appears first.
