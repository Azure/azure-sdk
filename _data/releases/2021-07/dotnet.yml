    #### Features Added

    - `EventData` now exposes the full AMQP message via the `GetRawAmqpMessage` method.  _(Based on a community prototype contribution, courtesy of [danielmarbach](https://github.com/danielmarbach))_

    - `EventData` now supports construction using a `string` to specify the event body; this will be represented as a set of UTF-8 encoded bytes for transport.

    - `EventData` has been extended to include properties for applications to assign a `MessageId`, `ContentType`, and `CorrelationId` as well-known members.  It is important to note that these properties are intended for application use and are not recognized by the Event Hubs service.

    -  When stopping, the `EventProcessor<TPartition>` will now attempt to force-close connections blocked on their timeout.  This should significantly help reduce the amount of time the processor takes to stop in many scenarios. _(Based on a community prototype contribution, courtesy of [danielmarbach](https://github.com/danielmarbach))_

    #### Key Bugs Fixed

    - The `EventProcessor<TPartition>` will now properly respect another another consumer stealing ownership of a partition when the service forcibly terminates the active link in the background.  Previously, the client did not observe the error directly and attempted to recover the faulted link which reasserted ownership and caused the partition to "bounce" between owners until a load balancing cycle completed.

    - The `EventHubConsumerClient` and `PartitionReceiver` will now properly surface an exception when another another consumer stealing ownership of a partition when the service forcibly terminates the active link in the background.  Previously, the client did not observe the error directly and did not make callers attempted to recover the faulted link which reasserted ownership and caused the partition to "bounce" between owners until a load balancing cycle completed.

 #### New features
 
- Added support for service version `3.0`. This can be specified in the `TextAnalyticsClientOptions` object under the `ServiceVersion` enum. By default the SDK targets latest supported service version.
- Added AAD support for the `StartAnalyzeHealthcareEntities` methods.
- Added value `None` to enum `PiiEntityDomainType` to allow user to specify no domain.
- Added new overload methods to all `xxActions` types that take a `xxOptions` object to facilitate a transition from a singular method to an actions method.
- The parameter `CategoriesFilter` in `RecognizePiiEntitiesActions` has been enabled for `StartAnalyzeActions` methods.
    #### Breaking changes

    #### Breaking changes
    - Changed behavior in `StartAnalyzeActions` and `StartAnalyzeActionsAsync` where now accepts a single action per action type. An `ArgumentException` is raised if duplicate actions are passed.
    - Changed type `RecognizePiiEntitiesOptions.DomainFilter` from `PiiEntityDomainType?` to `PiiEntityDomainType`.
    - Changed type `AnalyzeActionsOptions.IncludeStatistics` from `bool` to `bool?`.
    - Renamed `StartAnalyzeBatchActions` to `StartAnalyzeActions`.
    - Renamed `AnalyzeBatchActionsOperation` to `AnalyzeActionsOperation`.
    - Renamed `AnalyzeBatchActionsResult` to `AnalyzeActionsResult`.
    - Renamed `AnalyzeBatchActionsOptions` to `AnalyzeActionsOptions`.

    - `RecognizeEntitiesOptions` changed to new type `RecognizeEntitiesActions`.
    - `RecognizePiiEntitiesOptions` changed to new type `RecognizePiiEntitiesActions`.

    - Renamed type `PiiEntityDomainType` to `PiiEntityDomain`.
    - Renamed type `Results` to `DocumentsResults` in `AnalyzeSentimentActionResult`, `ExtractKeyPhrasesActionResult`, `RecognizeEntitiesActionResult`, `RecognizeLinkedEntitiesActionResult`, and `RecognizePiiEntitiesActionResult`.
    - Renamed all types under `AnalyzeActionsResult` from `xxActionsResults` to ``xxResults`.
    - Removed property `Statistics` from `AnalyzeActionsResult` as it is not currently returned by the service even if the user passes `IncludeStatistics  = true`.
    - Removed property `StringIndexType` from `TextAnalyticsRequestOptions`. This SDK will keep using `UTF-16` code unit as the default encoding.
    - Removed type `ExtractKeyPhrasesOptions` and respective exposure.
    - Removed type `RecognizeEntitiesOptions` and respective exposure.
    - Removed type `RecognizeLinkedEntitiesOptions` and respective exposure.

    #### Features Added

This should significantly help reduce the amount of time the processor takes to stop in many scenarios. _(Based on a community prototype contribution, courtesy of [danielmarbach](https://github.com/danielmarbach))_

    - When the `EventProcessorClient` detects a partition being stolen outside of a load balancing cycle, it will immediately surrender ownership rather than waiting for a load balancing cycle to confirm the ownership change.  This will help reduce event duplication from overlapping ownership of processors.

    #### Key Bugs Fixed

    - The `EventProcessorClient` will now properly respect another another consumer stealing ownership of a partition when the service forcibly terminates the active link in the background.  Previously, the client did not observe the error directly and attempted to recover the faulted link which reasserted ownership and caused the partition to "bounce" between owners until a load balancing cycle completed.
