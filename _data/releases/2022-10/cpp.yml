    #### Features Added

    - Added support for HTTP proxy servers, both unauthenticated and with Plain authentication.
    - Added universal support for several TLS options:
    - Added the ability to set the expected TLS root certificate for TLS connection (useful if a proxy server uses a TLS certificate that is not chained to a known root).
    - Added the ability to enable TLS certificate revocation list checks (off by default).
    - For libcurl only: Allow TLS connection to succeed if CRL retrieval fails.
    - *NOTE*: This change only applies if libcurl is built using the OpenSSL crypto backend. It does NOT apply if libcurl uses the schannel (Windows default) or SecureTransport (macOS/iOS default).

    #### Breaking Changes

    - Updated retry policy timeouts to conform to Azure guidelines.
    - The default delay between retries is changed from 4 seconds to 800ms.
    - The maximum retry delay is changed from 2 minutes to 60 seconds (one minute).

    If the original behavior is desired, customers can adjust these timeouts by changing the `RetryDelay` and `MaxRetryDelay` fields in the `RetryOptions` structure.
