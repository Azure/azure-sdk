  ChangelogContent: |-
    #### Features Added

    - Added support for parsing space character in place of 'T' in RFC3339 DateTimes.

    #### Breaking Changes

    - Bearer token authentication will not work for endpoint URL protocol schemes other than `"https"`. This ensures token security and is consistent with the Azure SDKs for other languages.
    - Removed `noexcept` specification from `Azure::DateTime::clock::now()`.
