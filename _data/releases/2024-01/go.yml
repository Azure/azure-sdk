    #### Features Added

    - Chat completions has been extended to accomodate new features:
    - Parallel function calling via Tools. See the function `ExampleClient_GetChatCompletions_functions` in `example_client_getchatcompletions_extensions_test.go` for an example of specifying a Tool.
    - "JSON mode", via `ChatCompletionOptions.ResponseFormat` for guaranteed function outputs.
    - ChatCompletions can now be used with both text and images using `gpt-4-vision-preview`.
    - Azure enhancements to `gpt-4-vision-preview` results that include grounding and OCR features
    - GetImageGenerations now works with DallE-3.
    - `-1106` model feature support for `gpt-35-turbo` and `gpt-4-turbo`, including use of a seed via `ChatCompletionsOptions.Seed` and system fingerprints returned in `ChatCompletions.SystemFingerprint`.
    - `dall-e-3` image generation capabilities via `GetImageGenerations`, featuring higher model quality, automatic prompt revisions by `gpt-4`, and customizable quality/style settings

    #### Breaking Changes

    - `azopenai.KeyCredential` has been replaced by [azcore.KeyCredential](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/sdk/azcore#KeyCredential).
    - `Deployment` has been renamed to `DeploymentName` throughout all APIs.
    - `CreateImage` has been replaced with `GetImageGenerations`.
