  ChangelogContent: |-
    #### Features Added

    - `-1106` model feature support for `gpt-35-turbo` and `gpt-4-turbo`, including use of `seed`, `system_fingerprint`,
    parallel function calling via tools, "JSON mode" for guaranteed function outputs, and more
    - `dall-e-3` image generation capabilities via `getImageGenerations`, featuring higher model quality, automatic prompt
    revisions by `gpt-4`, and customizable quality/style settings
    - Greatly expanded "On Your Data" capabilities in Azure OpenAI, including many new data source options and authentication
    mechanisms
    - Early support for `gpt-4-vision-preview`, which allows the hybrid use of text and images as input to enable scenarios
    like "describe this image for me"
    - Support for Azure enhancements to `gpt-4-vision-preview` results that include grounding and OCR features

    #### Breaking Changes

    - Removed methods `getAudioTranscriptionAsResponseObject` and `getAudioTranscriptionAsResponseObjectWithResponse` from `OpenAIClient` and `OpenAIAsyncClient` classes.
    Use `getAudioTranscription` or `getAudioTranscriptionWithResponse` convenience methods from respective classes.
    - Removed methods `getAudioTranslationAsResponseObject` and `getAudioTranslationAsResponseObjectWithResponse` from `OpenAIClient` and `OpenAIAsyncClient` classes.
    Use `getAudioTranslation` or `getAudioTranslationWithResponse` convenience methods from respective classes.

    **`ChatMessage` changes:**

    - The singular `ChatMessage` type has been replaced by `ChatRequestMessage` and `ChatResponseMessage`, the former of
    which is an abstract, polymorphic type with concrete derivations like `ChatRequestSystemMessage` and
    `ChatRequestUserMessage`. This requires conversion from old `ChatMessage` into the new types. While this is
    usually a straightforward string replacement, converting a response message into a request message (e.g. when
    propagating an assistant response to continue the conversation) will require creating a new instance of the
    appropriate request message with the response message's data. See the examples for details.

    **Dall-e-3:**

    - Azure OpenAI now uses `dall-e-3` model deployments for its image generation API and such a valid deployment must
    be provided into the options for the `getImageGenerations()` method to receive results.
