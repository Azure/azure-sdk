  ChangelogContent: |-
    #### Features Added

    - Add a new `bearerTokenChallengeAuthenticationPolicy` that provides a skeleton of handling challenge-based authorization. There are two extensible points: `authorizeRequest` and `authorizeRequestOnChallenge` callbacks.
      - `authorizeRequest` allows customizing the policy to alter how it authorizes a request before sending it. By default when no callbacks are specified, this policy has the same behavior as `bearerTokenAuthenticationPolicy`. It will retrieve the token from the underlying token credential, and if it gets one, it will cache the token and set it to the outgoing request.
      - `authorizeRequestOnChallenge`, which gets called only if we've found a challenge in the response. This callback has access to the original request and its response and is expected to handle the challenge. If this callback returns true, the request, usually updated after handling the challenge, will be sent again. If this call back returns false, no further actions will be taken.

    #### Fixed

    - Rewrote `bearerTokenAuthenticationPolicy` to use a new backend that refreshes tokens only when they're about to expire and not multiple times before. This is based on a similar fix implemented on `@azure/core-http@1.2.4` ([PR with the changes](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/pull/14223)). This fixes the issue: [13369](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/issues/13369).
    - Delay loading of NO_PROXY environment variable until when request pipeline is being created. This fixes [issue 14873](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/issues/14873)

    #### New Features

    - Adds support for passing `NamedKeyCredential` as the credential type to `ServiceBusClient` and `ServiceBusAdminstrationClient`. Also adds support for passing `SASCredential` to `ServiceBusClient`.
      These credential types support rotation via their `update` methods and are an alternative to using the `SharedAccessKeyName/SharedAccessKey` or `SharedAccessSignature` properties in a connection string.
      Resolves [#11891](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/issues/11891).

    #### Bug fixes

    - [Bug Fix] `expiresAtUtc` is `Invalid Date` in the received message when the ttl is not defined. Has been fixed in [#13543](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/pull/13543)
    - Some of the queue properties such as "forwardTo" and "autoDeleteOnIdle" were not being set as requested through the `ServiceBusAdministrationClient.createQueue` method because of a bug w.r.t the ordering of XML properties. The issue has been fixed in [#14692](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/pull/14692).
    - Settling messages now use the `retryOptions` passed to `ServiceBusClient`, making it more resilient against network failures.
      [PR#14867](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/pull/14867)

    #### Breaking Changes

    The public API surface of this library has been re-designed. Notable changes include

    - Removed: `ContainerRepositoryClient`. Operations on repositories are now grouped in `ContainerRepository` type and operations on artifacts are now in `RegistryArtifact` type. Some `*Options` types are also renamed accordingly.
    - Renamed: `endpoint` property is renamed to `registryUrl`.
    - Renamed: `listRepositories()` is renamed to `listRepositoryNames()` in `ContainerRegistryClient`.
    - Renamed: "RegistryArtifact" in property or function names replaced by "Manifest".
    - Renamed: `*OrderBy` values is now capitalized as `timeDesc` and `timeAsc`. Previously they are all in lower case.

  ChangelogContent: |-
    #### New features

    - Azure Identity for JavaScript no longer carries any native dependencies (neither ordinary, peer, nor optional dependencies). Previous distributions of `@azure/identity` carried an optional dependency on `keytar`, which caused issues for some users in restrictive environments.
    - Updated the `@azure/msal-node` dependency to version `^1.0.2`, which allows cancelling of an ongoing `getToken()` operation on `DeviceCodeCredential`.
    - Fixed issue with the logging of success messages on the `DefaultAzureCredential` and the `ChainedTokenCredential`. These messages will now mention the internal credential that succeeded.
    - `AuthenticationRequiredError` (introduced in 2.0.0-beta.1) now has the same impact on `ChainedTokenCredential` as the `CredentialUnavailableError` which is to allow the next credential in the chain to be tried.
    - `ManagedIdentityCredential` now retries with exponential back-off when a request for a token fails with a 404 status code on environments with available IMDS endpoints.
    - Added an `AzurePowerShellCredential` which will use the authenticated user session from the `Az.Account` PowerShell module. This credential will attempt to use PowerShell Core by calling `pwsh`, and on Windows it will fall back to Windows PowerShell (`powershell`) if PowerShell Core is not available.

    #### Breaking changes from 2.0.0-beta.1

    - Removed `VisualStudioCodeCredential`, as it requires us to list `keytar` as an optional dependency. `keytar` containes machine-code components that are difficult to build in certain environments, so this credential will be offered through a separate extension package in the future.
    - Removed token persistence through `@azure/msal-node-extensions`, as its machine-code components have the same problems as `keytar`. This functionality will similarly be reintroduced through a separate extension package in the future.
    - Removed `authenticationRecord`, `disableAutomaticAuthentication` and `authenticate()` from the credential `UsernamePasswordCredential`. While MSAL does support this, allowing `authenticationRecord` arguably could result in users authenticating through an account other than the one they're specifying with the username and the password.
