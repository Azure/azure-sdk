    - Fixed a bug with an error being raised when the fully-qualified namespace included a port, rather than ignoring the port. ([37547](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues/37547))

    #### Features Added

    - Added `ssl_context` parameter to the clients to allow users to pass in the SSL context, in which case, `connection_verify` will be ignored if specified.([#37246](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues/37246))

    #### Bugs Fixed

    * Fix tracing for asynchronous streaming.

    #### Features Added

    * OpenTelemetry tracing:
    * Method `AIInferenceInstrumentor().instrument()` updated with an input argument `enable_content_recording`.
    * Calling `AIInferenceInstrumentor().instrument()` twice no longer results in an exception.
    * Added method `AIInferenceInstrumentor().is_content_recording_enabled()`
    * Support [Prompty](https://github.com/microsoft/prompty) and prompt template from string. PromptTemplate class outputs an array of dictionary with OpenAI compatible message format.

  ChangelogContent: |-
    #### Features Added
    * Added response headers directly to SDK item point operation responses. See [PR 35791](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/pull/35791).
    * SDK will now retry all ServiceRequestErrors (failing outgoing requests) before failing. Default number of retries is 3. See [PR 36514](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/pull/36514).
    * Added Retry Policy for Container Recreate in the Python SDK. See [PR 36043](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/pull/36043)
    * Added option to disable write payload on writes. See [PR 37365](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/pull/37365)
    * Added get feed ranges API. See [PR 37687](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/pull/37687)
    * Added feed range support in `query_items_change_feed`. See [PR 37687](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/pull/37687)
    * Added **provisional** helper APIs for managing session tokens. See [PR 36971](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/pull/36971)
    * Added ability to get feed range for a partition key. See [PR 36971](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/pull/36971)

    #### Bugs Fixed
    * Consolidated Container Properties Cache to be in the Client to cache partition key definition and container rid to avoid unnecessary container reads. See [PR 35731](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/pull/35731).
    * Fixed bug with client hangs when running into WriteForbidden exceptions. See [PR 36514](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/pull/36514).
    * Added retry handling logic for DatabaseAccountNotFound exceptions. See [PR 36514](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/pull/36514).
    * Fixed SDK regex validation that would not allow for item ids to be longer than 255 characters. See [PR 36569](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/pull/36569).
    * Fixed issue where 'NoneType' object has no attribute error was raised when a session retry happened during a query. See [PR 37578](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/pull/37578).
    * Fixed issue where passing subpartition partition key values as a tuple in a query would raise an error. See [PR 38136](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/pull/38136)
    * Batch requests will now be properly considered as Write operation. See [PR 38365](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/pull/38365).

    #### Breaking Changes
    * Item-level point operations will now return `CosmosDict` and `CosmosList` response types.
    Responses will still be able to be used directly as previously, but will now have access to their response headers without need for a response hook. See [PR 35791](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/pull/35791).
