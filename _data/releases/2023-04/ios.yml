    #### Bugs fixed
    - Fixed typo in `cloudEnvironment` variable of `MicrosoftTeamsUserIdentifier`

    #### Features Added
    - Optimization added: When the proactive refreshing is enabled and the token refresher fails to provide a token that's not about to expire soon, the subsequent refresh attempts will be scheduled for when the token reaches half of its remaining lifetime until a token with long enough validity (>10 minutes) is obtained.
    - Added `cancel()` to `CommunicationTokenCredential` that cancels any internal auto-refresh operation. An instance of `CommunicationTokenCredential` cannot be reused once it has been canceled, otherwise the error will be returned.
    - Added support for a new communication identifier `MicrosoftBotIdentifier`.
