    - Removed allocations from Event Source logging by introducing `WriteEvent` overloads to handle cases that would otherwise result in boxing to `object[]` via params array.  _(A community contribution, courtesy of [danielmarbach](https://github.com/danielmarbach))_

    - Enhanced README documentation to call attention to the need for the Azure Storage container used with the processor to exist, and highlight that it will not be implicitly created.

    #### Other Changes

    - The `EventHubBufferedProducer` will now invoke the handlers for success or failure when publishing a batch in a deterministic manner, as part of the publishing flow.  Handlers will now be awaited, causing the publishing operation to be considered incomplete until the handler returns.  Previously, handlers were invoked in the background non-deterministically and without a guaranteed ordering.  This ensured they could not interfere with publishing throughput but caused difficulty for reliably checkpointing with the source of events.

    - Attempts to retrieve AMQP objects will first try synchronously before calling `GetOrCreateAsync`, to avoid an asynchronous call unless necessary.

    - Removed allocations from Event Source logging by introducing `WriteEvent` overloads to handle cases that would otherwise result in boxing to `object[]` via params array.  _(A community contribution, courtesy of [danielmarbach](https://github.com/danielmarbach))_

    - Removed LINQ from the `AmqpMessageConverter` in favor of direct looping.  _(Based on a community contribution, courtesy of [danielmarbach](https://github.com/danielmarbach))_

    - Changed the internal batch `AsEnumerable<T>` to `AsList<T>` in order to avoid casting costs and have `Count` available to right-size transform collections. _(Based on a community contribution, courtesy of [danielmarbach](https://github.com/danielmarbach))_

    - Moved to using the two item overload when creating a linked token source to avoid allocating an unnecessary array.  _(Based on a community contribution, courtesy of [danielmarbach](https://github.com/danielmarbach))_
