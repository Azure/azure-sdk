    - The `sender` property has been changed to `senderAddress`.
    - The `email` property under the recipient object has been changed to `address`.

    - The `contentBytesBase64` property under `attachments` has been changed to `contentInBase64`
    - Custom headers in the email message are now key/value pairs.
    - The importance property was removed. Email importance can now be specified through either the `x-priority` or `x-msmail-priority` custom headers.
