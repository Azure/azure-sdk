    #### Breaking Changes

    - The `upload` API throws an `AggregateLogsUploadError` in case of an error and returns `void` when operation succeeds.
    - Renamed `LogsUploadError` to `LogsUploadFailure`.

    #### Features Added

    - Added an error callback functionality for inspecting individual log uploads via `LogsUploadOptions`.
