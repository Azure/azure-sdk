    #### Bugs Fixed

    - The `Content-Length` header in a http response is strictly checked against the actual number of bytes in the body,
    rather than silently truncating data in case the underlying tcp connection is closed prematurely.
    (thanks to @jochen-ott-by for the contribution)   #20412
    - UnboundLocalError when SansIOHTTPPolicy handles an exception    #15222
    - Add default content type header of `text/plain` and content length header for users who pass unicode strings to the `content` kwarg of `HttpRequest` in 2.7  #21550
    - respect text encoding specified in argument (thanks to @ryohji for the contribution)  #20796
    - Fix "coroutine x.read() was never awaited" warning from `ContentDecodePolicy`  #21318
    - fix type check for `data` input to `azure.core.rest` for python 2.7 users  #21341
    - use `charset_normalizer` if `chardet` is not installed to migrate aiohttp 3.8.0 changes.
    - Correctly set response's content to decompressed body when users are using aiohttp transport with decompression headers #21620

    #### Features Added

    - GA `send_request` onto the `azure.core.PipelineClient` and `azure.core.AsyncPipelineClient`. This method takes in
    requests and sends them through our pipelines.
    - GA `azure.core.rest`. `azure.core.rest` is our new public simple HTTP library in `azure.core` that users will use to create requests, and consume responses.
    - GA errors `StreamConsumedError`, `StreamClosedError`, and `ResponseNotReadError` to `azure.core.exceptions`. These errors
    are thrown if you mishandle streamed responses from the `azure.core.rest` module
    - add kwargs to the methods for `iter_raw` and `iter_bytes`  #21529
    - no longer raise JSON errors if users pass in file descriptors of JSON to the `json` kwarg in `HttpRequest`  #21504
    - Added new error type `IncompleteReadError` which is raised if peer closes the connection before we have received the complete message body.

    #### Breaking Changes

    - SansIOHTTPPolicy.on_exception returns None instead of bool.

    #### Bugs Fixed
    - Fix the issue that data was persisted according to an incorrect schema/in an incorrect format ([#20518](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues/20518))

    `SecretReferenceConfigurationSetting` in 1.2.0 used "secret_uri" rather than "uri" as the schema keywords which
    broken inter-operation of `SecretReferenceConfigurationSetting` between SDK and the portal.

    Please:
    - Use 1.3.0+ for any `SecretReferenceConfigurationSetting` uses.
    - Call a get method for existing `SecretReferenceConfigurationSetting`s and set them back to correct the format.
