    #### Bugs Fixed

    - `FeatureFlagConfigurationSetting` and `SecretReferenceConfigurationSetting` will now retain custom attributes in the setting value.  Previously, only attributes that were defined in the associated JSON schema were allowed and unknown attributes were discarded.

    - Added the ability to create `FeatureFlagConfigurationSetting` and `SecretReferenceConfigurationSetting` instances with an ETag, matching `ConfigurationSetting`.  This allows all setting types to use the [GetConfigurationSettingAsync](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/azure.data.appconfiguration.configurationclient.getconfigurationsettingasync?view=azure-dotnet#azure-data-appconfiguration-configurationclient-getconfigurationsettingasync(azure-data-appconfiguration-configurationsetting-system-boolean-system-threading-cancellationtoken)) overload that accepts `onlyIfUnchanged.`  Previously, this was not possible for specialized settings types.

    - Added the ability to create `FeatureFlagConfigurationSetting` and `SecretReferenceConfigurationSetting` instances for testing purposes using the `ConfigurationModelFactory`. It was previously not possible to populate service-owned fields when testing.

    - Marked a constructor overload of `ConfigurationSetting` that was intended for testing purposes as non-visible, as the `ConfigurationModelFactory` should instead be used.

    - Fixed a bug where a disposed content stream was used to attempt deserialization in some scenarios, such as using a custom `HttpMessageHandler` that returns `StringContent`.

    #### Bugs Fixed

    - When using the `EventHubBufferedProducerClient`, events are now instrumented when `EnqueueEventAsync` or `EnqueueEventsAsync` is called, rather than when the event is published. This ensures that the instrumentation is accurate when the event is published, regardless of whether the event is published immediately or buffered for a period of time.
