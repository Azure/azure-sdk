    #### Bugs Fixed

    - Ensure `AzurePowershellCredential` calls PowerShell with the `-NoProfile` flag to avoid loading user profiles for more consistent behavior.  ([#31682](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/pull/31682))
    - Fixed an issue with subprocess-based developer credentials (such as AzureCliCredential) where the process would sometimes hang waiting for user input.  ([#31534](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/pull/31534))
    - Fixed an issue with `ClientAssertionCredential` not properly checking if CAE should be enabled.  ([#31544](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/pull/31544))
    - `ManagedIdentityCredential` will fall through to the next credential in the chain in the case that Docker Desktop returns a 403 response when attempting to access the IMDS endpoint.  ([#31824](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/pull/31824))

    #### Features Added

    - Added Windows Web Account Manager (WAM) Brokered Authentication support.
    - Added `enable_msa_passthrough` suppport for `InteractiveBrowserCredential`. By default `InteractiveBrowserCredential` only lists AAD accounts. If you set `enable_msa_passthrough` to `True`, it lists both AAD accounts and MSA outlook.com accounts that are logged in to Windows.
