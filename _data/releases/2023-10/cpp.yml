    #### Breaking Changes

    - Storage names used for checkpoint store have been normalized to match behavior of other Azure SDK eventhubs packages.
    - `EventDataBatch` object can no longer be directly created but instead must be created via `ProducerClient::CreateEventDataBatch`.
    - `EventDataBatch::AddMessage` method has been renamed to `EventDataBatch::TryAddMessage` and it now returns false if the message will not fit.
    - `SendEventDataBatch` method has been renamed to `Send` and it now returns a void (throwing an exception of the send fails).

    #### Bugs Fixed

    - Setting `PartitionClientOptions::StartPosition::EnqueuedTime` now works as expected.
    - Internally restructured how AMQP senders and receivers are configured to simplify code and significantly improve reliability.

    #### Features Added

    - `ProducerClient` now has convenience methods for sending events without batching.
    - Added `std::ostream` insertion operators for model types to simplify debugging.
