    #### Bugs Fixed

    - Several fixes related to the new asynchronous model. Ensures that message senders and receivers are always closed,
    and that resources are released.

    #### Breaking Changes

    - Removed the `QueueSend` API from `MessageSender` because it was not compatible with the new asynchronous model.
    - The new asynchronous model requires the user to call `Close()` on the `MessageSender` and `MessageReceiver`
    to ensure operations have stabilized before destroying the object.
    - For connection listeners (primarily test scenarios), if you call `Open()` or `Listen()` on a connection, you MUST call `Close()`
    before the connection is destroyed.
    - The `Connection::Close()` method no longer requires that the caller provide connection disconnect information.
    - The `Session::End()` method no longer requires that the caller provide session disconnect information.
    - Several asserts have been added which will force termination of the running application if invariants have not been met.

    #### Features Added

    - AMQP moved from a polling model to an asynchronous model.
    - Added a new `MessageReceiver::TryWaitForIncomingMessage` API which allows callers to "peek" at the contents of
    the incoming message queue, returning an already received message or an empty message if none is available.
