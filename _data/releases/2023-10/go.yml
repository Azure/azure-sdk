  ChangelogUrl: https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/tree/sdk/azidentity/v1.4.0-beta.5/sdk/azidentity/CHANGELOG.md
  ChangelogContent: |-
    #### Bugs Fixed
    * Credential chains such as `DefaultAzureCredential` now try their next credential, if any, when
    managed identity authentication fails in a Docker Desktop container
    ([#21417](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/issues/21417))

    #### Breaking Changes
    > These changes affect only code written against a beta version such as v1.4.0-beta.4
    * Whether `GetToken` requests a CAE token is now determined by `TokenRequestOptions.EnableCAE`. Azure
    SDK clients which support CAE will set this option automatically. Credentials no longer request CAE
    tokens by default or observe the environment variable "AZURE_IDENTITY_DISABLE_CP1".

    #### Features Added
    * Service principal credentials can request CAE tokens
