    #### Bugs Fixed

    - Retries now respect cancellation when they're in the "delay before next try" phase. (PR#19295)
    - Fixed a potential leak which could cause us to open and leak a $cbs link connection, resulting in errors. (PR#19326)

    #### Breaking Changes

    - EventDataBatch.NumMessages() renamed to EventDataBatch.NumEvents()
    - Prefetch is now enabled by default. To disable it set PartitionClientOptions.Prefetch to -1.
    - NewWebSocketConnArgs renamed to WebSocketConnParams
    - Code renamed to ErrorCode, including associated constants like `ErrorCodeOwnershipLost`.
    - OwnershipData, CheckpointData, and CheckpointStoreAddress have been folded into their individual structs: Ownership and Checkpoint.
    - StartPosition and OwnerLevel were erroneously included in the ConsumerClientOptions struct - they've been removed. These can be
    configured in the PartitionClientOptions.

    #### Features Added

    - Raw AMQP message support, including full support for encoding Body (Value, Sequence and also multiple byte slices for Data). See ExampleEventDataBatch_AddEventData_rawAMQPMessages for some concrete examples. (PR#19156)
    - Prefetch is now enabled by default. Prefetch allows the Event Hubs client to maintain a continuously full cache of events, controlled by PartitionClientOptions.Prefetch. (PR#19281)
    - ConsumerClient.ID() returns a unique ID representing each instance of ConsumerClient.
