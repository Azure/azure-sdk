  ChangelogContent: |-
    #### New Features
    - Add property `azure.activedirectory.application-type` to configure the application type.

    Here are the 4 valid values:
    - *web_application*: Web Application.
    - *resource_server*: Resource Server.
    - *resource_server_with_obo*: Resource Server with authorization grant type `on_behalf_of`.
    - *web_application_and_resource_server*: Web Application and Resource Server in one application, it also supports `on_behalf_of`.

    This property is optional, its value can be inferred by dependencies, only `web_application_and_resource_server` must be configured manually: `azure.activedirectory.application-type=web_application_and_resource_server`.

    Here is the table about how the AAD starter infers application type by dependencies:

    | Has dependency: spring-security-oauth2-client | Has dependency: spring-security-oauth2-resource-server |                  Valid values of application type                 | Default value               |
    |-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
    |                      Yes                      |                          No                            |                       `web_application`                           |       `web_application`     |
    |                      No                       |                          Yes                           |                       `resource_server`                           |       `resource_server`     |
    |                      Yes                      |                          Yes                           | `resource_server_with_obo`, `web_application_and_resource_server` | `resource_server_with_obo`  |

    - Support new value `on_behalf_of` for OBO authorization grant type, originally we only support `on-behalf-of`.

    #### New Features
    - Add property `azure.activedirectory.application-type` to configure the application type.

    Here are the 4 valid values:
    - *web_application*: Web Application.
    - *resource_server*: Resource Server.
    - *resource_server_with_obo*: Resource Server with authorization grant type `on_behalf_of`.
    - *web_application_and_resource_server*: Web Application and Resource Server in one application, it also supports `on_behalf_of`.

    This property is optional, its value can be inferred by dependencies, only `web_application_and_resource_server` must be configured manually: `azure.activedirectory.application-type=web_application_and_resource_server`.

    Here is the table about how the AAD starter infers application type by dependencies:

    | Has dependency: spring-security-oauth2-client | Has dependency: spring-security-oauth2-resource-server |                  Valid values of application type                 | Default value               |
    |-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
    |                      Yes                      |                          No                            |                       `web_application`                           |       `web_application`     |
    |                      No                       |                          Yes                           |                       `resource_server`                           |       `resource_server`     |
    |                      Yes                      |                          Yes                           | `resource_server_with_obo`, `web_application_and_resource_server` | `resource_server_with_obo`  |

    - Support new value `on_behalf_of` for OBO authorization grant type, originally we only support `on-behalf-of`.

    #### Feature Added

    - Added `HttpRequestLogger`, `HttpResponseLogger`, and correlating context classes to enable support for custom
    logging in `HttpLoggingPolicy`. ([#16088](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/pull/16088))
    - Added new constructor overload to `AzureSasCredential` to enable passing a `Function` which encodes the SAS
    credential. ([#23033](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/pull/23033))
    - Added a new constructor `HttpHeaders(int initialCapacity)` which allows configuration of the initial backing map
    capacity may allow short-circuiting scenarios where the map would need to be resized and copied in memory.
    - Added Maven profiles to enable the creation of an uber JAR with OS specific dependencies of
    `netty-tcnative-boringssl-static` instead of including all OS dependencies. ([#21223](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/pull/21223))

    - Added support to create tracing spans with customizations. ([#23159](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/pull/23159))

    #### Fixed

    - Fixed a bug where `Tracer.DIAGNOSTIC_ID_KEY`'s value was spelt incorrect.
    - Fixed a bug where loading system and Java proxies used `java.net.useSystemProxies` incorrectly. ([#23151](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/pull/23151))
    - Fixed a bug with context propagation through EventHub and ServiceBus between Java and other languages.
    - Fixed a bug where classes annotated with `@JsonFlatten` would incorrectly split `Map` keys on `.` and flatten them. ([#22591](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/pull/22591))
    - Fixed a bug where creating a `ClientLogger` would throw `InvalidPathException` when constructing a `DefaultLogger`
    with a name that contained illegal path characters on Windows.
    - Fixed a bug where `FluxUtil.writeFile` would attempt to write to `ByteBuffer`s to the same location in file.
