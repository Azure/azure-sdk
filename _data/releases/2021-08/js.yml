    - With this release, we drop support for Node.js versions that have reached the end of life, like Node.js 8. Read our [support policy](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/main/SUPPORT.md) for more details.
    - Updated the default timeout of the first request of the IMDS MSI from half a second to three seconds to compensate for the slowness caused by `node-fetch` for initial requests in specific environments, like Kubernetes pods.
    - Upgraded `@azure/core-http` to version `^2.0.0`, and `@azure/core-tracing` to version `1.0.0-preview.12`.

    #### Features Added
    - With the dropping of support for Node.js versions that are no longer in LTS, the dependency on `@types/node` has been updated to version 12. Read our [support policy](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/main/SUPPORT.md) for more details.
    - Added background refresher for endpoints, and new `ConnectionPolicy` options. Refreshing defaults to true, and the default refresh rate is every 5 minutes.
    ```js
    const client = new CosmosClient({
    endpoint,
    key: masterKey,
    connectionPolicy: {
    ...defaultConnectionPolicy,
    endpointRefreshRateInMs: 700,
    enableBackgroundEndpointRefreshing: true
    }
    })
    ```

    - Added `client.dispose()` for closing the endpoint refresher verbosely. Necessary when destroying the CosmosClient inside existing processes like an express web server, or when you want to destroy the client and create a new one in the same process.
    ```js
    const client = new CosmosClient()
    client.dispose() // cancels background endpoint refreshing
    ```

  ChangelogContent: |-
    #### Features Added

    - Added support for disabling distributed tracing using the AZURE_TRACING_DISABLED environment variable.

    #### Breaking Changes

    - Removed `TestTracer` and `TestSpan` from public API and into `@azure/test-utils`. [PR #16315](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/pull/16315)
    - `TestTracer` and `TestSpan` are intended for test support when used by other Azure packages and not intended for use by end users.
    - Removed `setTracer`, @azure/core-tracing will now rely on the `trace` API to fetch a tracer from the global tracer provider. [PR #16347](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/pull/16347)
    - If you are using `setTracer`, please use `trace.setGlobalTracerProvider(provider)` instead as described in the OpenTelemetry documentation.
    - Removed `NoOpTracer` and `NoOpSpan` from the public API. Please use `trace.wrapSpanContext(INVALID_SPAN_CONTEXT)` from `@opentelemetry/api` instead. [PR #16315](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/pull/16315)

    of a `TokenCredential` as the credential. See the readme for [`@azure/identity`](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/main/sdk/identity/identity) to learn
    more about using Azure Active Directory for authentication.
