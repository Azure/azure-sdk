    - With this release, we drop support for Node.js versions that have reached the end of life, like Node.js 8. Read our [support policy](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/main/SUPPORT.md) for more details.
    - Updated the default timeout of the first request of the IMDS MSI from half a second to three seconds to compensate for the slowness caused by `node-fetch` for initial requests in specific environments, like Kubernetes pods.
    - Upgraded `@azure/core-http` to version `^2.0.0`, and `@azure/core-tracing` to version `1.0.0-preview.12`.

    #### Features Added
    - With the dropping of support for Node.js versions that are no longer in LTS, the dependency on `@types/node` has been updated to version 12. Read our [support policy](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/main/SUPPORT.md) for more details.
    - Added background refresher for endpoints, and new `ConnectionPolicy` options. Refreshing defaults to true, and the default refresh rate is every 5 minutes.
    ```js
    const client = new CosmosClient({
    endpoint,
    key: masterKey,
    connectionPolicy: {
    ...defaultConnectionPolicy,
    endpointRefreshRateInMs: 700,
    enableBackgroundEndpointRefreshing: true
    }
    })
    ```

    - Added `client.dispose()` for closing the endpoint refresher verbosely. Necessary when destroying the CosmosClient inside existing processes like an express web server, or when you want to destroy the client and create a new one in the same process.
    ```js
    const client = new CosmosClient()
    client.dispose() // cancels background endpoint refreshing

    #### Features Added

    - Added support for disabling distributed tracing using the AZURE_TRACING_DISABLED environment variable.

    #### Breaking Changes

    - Removed `TestTracer` and `TestSpan` from public API and into `@azure/test-utils`. [PR #16315](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/pull/16315)
    - `TestTracer` and `TestSpan` are intended for test support when used by other Azure packages and not intended for use by end users.
    - Removed `setTracer`, @azure/core-tracing will now rely on the `trace` API to fetch a tracer from the global tracer provider. [PR #16347](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/pull/16347)
    - If you are using `setTracer`, please use `trace.setGlobalTracerProvider(provider)` instead as described in the OpenTelemetry documentation.
    - Removed `NoOpTracer` and `NoOpSpan` from the public API. Please use `trace.wrapSpanContext(INVALID_SPAN_CONTEXT)` from `@opentelemetry/api` instead. [PR #16315](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/pull/16315)

    - `EventGridPublisherClient` now supports Azure Active Directory (AAD) for authentication. When constructing an `EventGridPublisherClient` you may now pass an instance
    of a `TokenCredential` as the credential. See the readme for [`@azure/identity`](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/main/sdk/identity/identity) to learn
    more about using Azure Active Directory for authentication.

    - Updated our internal core package dependencies to their latest versions in order to add support for Opentelemetry 1.0.0 which is compatible with the latest versions of our other client libraries.

    #### Bugs Fixed

    - Throttling may have resulted in retrying the request indefinitely if the service responded with `retry-after-ms` header in the error for each retried request. The behaviour has been changed to retry for a maximum of 3 times by default from [#16376](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/pull/16376).
    - Additionally, [#16376](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/pull/16376) also exposes retryOptions on the `AppConfigurationClient`'s client options, which lets you configure the `maxRetries` and the `maxRetryDelayInMs`.

    This is the first preview for the new version of the `@azure/arm-compute` package that follows the new [guidelines for TypeScript SDKs](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/typescript_introduction.html) for Azure services.

    While this package remains auto generated, the SDK generator itself has undergone changes to comply with the above guidelines in order to generate packages that are idiomatic to the JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem and consistent with other packages for Azure services. For more on this, please see [State of the Azure SDK 2021](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/azure-sdk/state-of-the-azure-sdk-2021/).

    Please note that this version has breaking changes, all of which were made after careful consideration during the authoring of the guidelines and user studies.

    **Noteworthy changes and features**
    - Authentication: The packages `@azure/ms-rest-nodeauth` or `@azure/ms-rest-browserauth` are no longer supported. Use package [@azure/identity](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/identity) instead. Select a credential from Azure Identity examples based on the authentication method of your choice.
    - Callbacks: Method overloads that used callbacks have been removed and the use of promises is encouraged instead.
    - List operations now return an iterable result that follows the `PagedAsyncIterableIterator` interface as opposed to the previous model where you had to make a new request using the link to the next page.
    - Long running operations i.e. the Lro related object returned by methods whose names started with `begin`, now uses `pollUntilDone` to check whether the request is finished, instead of `pollUntilFinished`. To get the final result, use the corresponding method that will have the suffix `AndWait`.
    - The SDK only supports ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) and beyond, all projects that referenced this SDK should be upgraded to use ES6.

    Please note that this version has breaking changes, all of which were made after careful consideration during the authoring of the guidelines and user studies.

    **Noteworthy changes and features**
    - Authentication: The packages `@azure/ms-rest-nodeauth` or `@azure/ms-rest-browserauth` are no longer supported. Use package [@azure/identity](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/identity) instead. Select a credential from Azure Identity examples based on the authentication method of your choice.
    - Callbacks: Method overloads that used callbacks have been removed and the use of promises is encouraged instead.
    - List operations now return an iterable result that follows the `PagedAsyncIterableIterator` interface as opposed to the previous model where you had to make a new request using the link to the next page.
    - Long running operations i.e. the Lro related object returned by methods whose names started with `begin`, now uses `pollUntilDone` to check whether the request is finished, instead of `pollUntilFinished`. To get the final result, use the corresponding method that will have the suffix `AndWait`.
    - The SDK only supports ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) and beyond, all projects that referenced this SDK should be upgraded to use ES6.

    This is the first preview for the new version of the `@azure/arm-resources` package that follows the new [guidelines for TypeScript SDKs](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/typescript_introduction.html) for Azure services.

    While this package remains auto generated, the SDK generator itself has undergone changes to comply with the above guidelines in order to generate packages that are idiomatic to the JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem and consistent with other packages for Azure services.
