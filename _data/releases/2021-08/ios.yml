  ChangelogContent: |-
    #### Features Added
    - `Recording` and `Transcription` features are decoupled from `Call` object and now can only be used via extensions.
    Usage example:
    ```
    let recordingFeature = self.call!.api(RecordingFeature.self)
    recordingFeature.delegate = self.callObserver
    ```

    #### Breaking Changes
    - Changed: `didChangeRecordingState` and `didChangeTranscriptionState` are moved out of `CallDelegate` into `RecordingFeatureDelegate` and into `TranscriptionFeatureDelegate`.

    **More documentation on extensions and the breaking change can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/voice-video-calling/calling-client-samples?pivots=platform-ios).**

    #### Bugs Fixed
    - Not triggering calldidChangeState if using createCallAgentWithCallKitOption. And not able to accept the call in App killed state ([#316](https://github.com/Azure/Communication/issues/316)).
    - Remote participant stream is stretched after hang-up ([#311](https://github.com/Azure/Communication/issues/311)).
    - CallKit bug fixes with sometimes call gets disconnected immediately after picking up the call.
    - Intermittent freezing of UI thread issue is fixed when for e.g. reading property `remoteParticipants` in a `Call`.
    - `Hold` and `Resume` support fixed with CallKit enabled `CallAgent`'s.
