    #### Features Added

    - Added a `webPubSubClientProtocol` option to `GenerateClientTokenOptions` to specify the type of client when generating token. This option can be used to generate token and client connection URL for a specific client type, such as `Default` or `MQTT`.
    - Added a `addConnectionsToGroups` method to `WebPubSubServiceClient` and `WebPubSubServiceAsyncClient` to add filtered connections to multiple groups.
    - Migrated serialization to `azure-json` which offers implementation agnostic serialization, providing support for
    more serialization frameworks than just Jackson.

    #### Breaking Changes

    - Removed Jackson annotations from models and removed custom serializer for raw JSON fields.
