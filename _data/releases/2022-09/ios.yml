  ChangelogContent: |-
    #### New Features
    - Introduce new `createCommunicationIdentifier(from: )` to translate between a CommunicationIdentifier and its underlying canonical rawId representation. Developers can now use the rawId as an encoded format for identifiers to store in their databases or as stable keys in general.
    - Introduce new `rawId` getter property in the `CommunicationIdentifier` protocol to return rawId representation.
    - Introduce new `kind` getter property in the `CommunicationIdentifier` protocol to return string representation of the kind of identifer developers are woking with.

    #### Key Bug Fixes
    - Previously `rawId` was an optional property in `PhoneNumberIdentifier`. Updated the `rawId` to be required, and always corresponds with the phone number. This will cause compilation errors.
