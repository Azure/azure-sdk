  ChangelogContent: |-
    #### Features Added
    - Added support for service version 2024-05-04.
    - The `services` parameter has been added to the `generate_account_sas` API, which enables the ability to generate SAS
    tokens to be used with multiple services. By default, the SAS token service scope will default to the current service.

    #### Bugs Fixed
    - Bumped dependency of `typing-extensions` to `>=4.6.0` to avoid potential `TypeError` with `typing.TypeVar` on
    Python 3.12.
    - Fixed an issue where authentication errors could raise `AttributeError` instead of `ClientAuthenticationError` when
    using async OAuth credentials.
    - Fixed a typing issue which incorrectly typed the `readinto` API. The correct input type is `IO[bytes]`.
    - Fixed a typo in the initialization of `completion_time` for the `CopyProperties` model.
    - Fixed a couple of issues with `upload_blob` when using Iterators/Generators as the data input.

  ChangelogContent: |-
    #### Features Added
    - Added `exists` method to `ShareFileClient` to check if a file exists.
    - Added support for service version 2024-05-04.
    - The `services` parameter has been added to the `generate_account_sas` API, which enables the ability to generate SAS
    tokens to be used with multiple services. By default, the SAS token service scope will default to the current service.

    #### Bugs Fixed
    - Fixed an issue where the `ShareDirectoryClient` returned by `get_subdirectory_client` with a `ShareDirectoryClient`
    pointing to the root of the file share would raise an `InvalidResourceName` on any operations.
    - Bumped dependency of `typing-extensions` to `>=4.6.0` to avoid potential `TypeError` with `typing.TypeVar` on
    Python 3.12.
    - Fixed an issue where authentication errors could raise `AttributeError` instead of `ClientAuthenticationError` when
    using async OAuth credentials.
    - Fixed an issue where parameter `delete_snapshots` to `delete_share` API did not support all possible enums. This change
    makes `delete_snapshots` now accept string literals 'include' and 'include-leased'.
    - Fixed an issue where specifying datetime objects with less than 7 digits of precision as input could incorrectly raise
    `InvalidHeaderValue` due to improper precision parsing.
