    ### New Features

    -  When stopping, the `EventProcessor<TPartition>` will now attempt to aggressively abort the connection to avoid blocking on timeouts.  This should significantly help reduce the amount of time the processor takes to stop in many scenarios. _(Based on a community prototype contribution, courtesy of [danielmarbach](https://github.com/danielmarbach))_

    - When the `EventProcessor<TPartition>` detects a partition being stolen outside of a load balancing cycle, it will immediately surrender ownership rather than waiting for a load balancing cycle to confirm the ownership change.  This will help reduce event duplication from overlapping ownership of partitions.

    - The `EventProcessor<TPartition>` now exposes the `ListPartitionIdsAsync` method, allowing custom processors to control the set of partitions known to the processor.  This can be used to reduce complexity when a custom processor is directly assigned a set of partitions to process rather than using load balancing to control ownership.

    - The `ConnectionOptions` available when creating client types now support registering a callback delegate for participating in the validation of SSL certificates when connections are established.  This delegate may override the built-in validation and allow or deny certificates based on application-specific logic.



    ### Key Bug Fixes

    - The `EventProcessor<TPartition>` will now properly respect another another consumer stealing ownership of a partition when the service forcibly terminates the active link in the background.  Previously, the client did not observe the error directly and attempted to recover the faulted link which reasserted ownership and caused the partition to "bounce" between owners until a load balancing cycle completed.

    - The `EventProcessor<TPartition>` will now be less aggressive when considering whether or not to steal a partition, doing so only when it will correct an imbalance and preferring the status quo when the overall distribution would not change.  This will help reduce event duplication due to partitions moving between owners.

    Thank you to our developer community members who helped to make the Event Hubs client libraries better with their contributions to this release:

    #### Changes

    ##### New Features

    -  When stopping, the `EventProcessorClient` will now attempt to force-close the connection to the Event Hubs service to abort in-process read operations blocked on their timeout.  This should significantly help reduce the amount of time the processor takes to stop in many scenarios. _(Based on a community prototype contribution, courtesy of [danielmarbach](https://github.com/danielmarbach))_

    - When the `EventProcessorClient` detects a partition being stolen outside of a load balancing cycle, it will immediately surrender ownership rather than waiting for a load balancing cycle to confirm the ownership change.

    - The `ConnectionOptions` available when creating a processor now support registering a callback delegate for participating in the validation of SSL certificates when connections are established.  This delegate may override the built-in validation and allow or deny certificates based on application-specific logic.

    - The `ConnectionOptions` available when creating a processor now support setting a custom size for the send and receive buffers of the transport.

    #### New Features
    - Added `DatasourceCredential` CRUD operations to the `MetricsAdvisorAdministrationClient`. This API provides new ways of authenticating to a `DataFeedSource`.
    - Added property `Authentication` to data sources `AzureBlobDataFeedSource`, `AzureDataExplorerDataFeedSource`, `AzureDataLakeStorageGen2DataFeedSource`, and `SqlServerDataFeedSource` to specify the authentication type to use.
    - Added property `DatasourceCredentialId` to data sources `AzureDataExplorerDataFeedSource`, `AzureDataLakeStorageGen2DataFeedSource`, and `SqlServerDataFeedSource` to specify the datasource credential to use for authentication.
    - Added properties `Value` and `ExpectedValue` to `DataPointAnomaly` to provide more information about the anomalous data point.
    - Added properties `ValueOfRootNode` and `ExpectedValueOfRootNode` to `AnomalyIncident` to provide more information about the anomalous data point at the root node of the indicent.
    - Response headers that were marked as `REDACTED` in error messages and logs are now exposed by default.
    - `GetDetectionConfigurations` and `GetAlertConfigurations` in the `MetricsAdvisorAdministrationClient` can now take a set of options with `Skip` and `MaxPageSize` properties to configure paging behavior.
    - Added setters to models that use the Update APIs to make updating easier.
    - Added property `DataFeedId` to `DataPointAnomaly` and `AnomalyIncident`.
    - Added two new data feed sources: `AzureEventHubsDataFeedSource` and `LogAnalyticsDataFeedSource`.

    #### Breaking Changes
    - Update methods will now return the updated entity instead of an empty response. For example, `UpdateDataFeed` now returns a `Response<DataFeed>`.
    - `NotificationHook.ExternalLink` and `WebNotificationHook.Endpoint` are now of type `Uri`.
    - Removed setter from `GetIncidentsForDetectionConfigurationOptions.DimensionsToFilter`. Elements can be added directly to it without user instantiation.
    - Renamed all `SkipCount` listing options to `Skip`. Affected classes include `GetAlertsOptions`, `GetDataFeedsOptions`, `GetHooksOptions`, and others.
    - Renamed all `TopCount` listing options to `MaxPageSize`. Affected classes include `GetAlertsOptions`, `GetDataFeedsOptions`, `GetHooksOptions`, and others.
    - Removed data feed sources `ElasticsearchDataFeedSource` and `HttpRequestDataFeedSource` as they are not supported by the service anymore. A different type of data feed source must be used for data ingestion instead.
    - Removed getters for secrets in data feed sources, such as `AzureBlobDataFeedSource.ConnectionString` and `InfluxDbDataFeedSource.Password`.
    - Removed granularity type `DataFeedGranularityType.PerSecond` as it's not supported by the service anymore.
    - Renamed method `GetDimensionValues` to `GetMetricDimensionValues` in `MetricsAdvisorClient`. The associated options type `GetDimensionValuesOptions` has been renamed as well.
    - Renamed method `GetValuesOfDimensionWithAnomalies` to `GetAnomalyDimensionValues` in `MetricsAdvisorClient`. The associated options type `GetValuesOfDimensionWithAnomaliesOptions` has been renamed as well.
    - In `MetricsAdvisorAdministrationClient`, Update operations such as `UpdateDataFeed` don't take the ID as a method parameter anymore. You now need to pass an instance that has been returned from another CRUD operation and has its `Id` property populated.
    - In `AnomalyIncident`, renamed `DimensionKey` to `RootDimensionKey`.
    - In `DataFeed`, renamed `Administrators` to `AdministratorsEmails`, `Creator` to `CreatorEmail`, and `Viewers` to `ViewersEmails`.
    - In `DataFeedDimension`, renamed `DimensionName` to `Name`, and `DimensionDisplayName` to `DisplayName`.
    - In `DataFeedMetric`, renamed `MetricId` to `Id`, `MetricName` to `Name`, `MetricDisplayName` to `DisplayName`, and `MetricDescription` to `Description`.
    - In `DataFeedAutoRollupMethod`, renamed `RollupMethod` to `AutoRollupMethod`.
    - In `IncidentRootCause`, renamed `DimensionKey` to `SeriesKey`, and `Score` to `ContributionScore`.
    - In `MetricBoundaryCondition`, renamed `TriggerForMissing` to `ShouldAlertIfDataPointMissing`.
    - In `MetricEnrichedSeriesData`, renamed `Values` to `MetricValues`, `ExpectedValues` to `ExpectedMetricValues`, `LowerBoundaries` to `LowerBoundaryValues`, and `UpperBoundaries` to `UpperBoundaryValues`.
    - In `MetricSeriesData`, renamed `Values` to `MetricValues`.
    - In `NotificationHook`, renamed `Administrators` to `AdministratorsEmails`.
