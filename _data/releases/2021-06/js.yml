    #### New Features

    - Added new System Event: `Microsoft.Storage.BlobInventoryPolicyCompleted`

    #### Key Bug Fixes

    - The `Microsoft.ServiceBus.DeadletterMessagesAvailableWithNoListeners` event was incorrectly listed with the name of `Microsoft.ServiceBus.DeadletterMessagesAvailableWithNoListener`.
    This has been corrected. When using TypeScript, you will need to replace any calls to `isSystemEvent("Microsoft.ServiceBus.DeadletterMessagesAvailableWithNoListener")` with
    `isSystemEvent("Microsoft.ServiceBus.DeadletterMessagesAvailableWithNoListeners")`.

    - With [#15136](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/pull/15136), if the key of a feature flag(setting with `contentType="application/vnd.microsoft.appconfig.ff+json;charset=utf-8"`) doesn't start with `".appconfig.featureflag/"` (featureFlagPrefix), SDK adds the prefix before sending the request.
    - New design for feature flags and secret references,
    - New types for FeatureFlag and SecretReference - `ConfigurationSetting<FeatureFlagValue>` and `ConfigurationSetting<SecretReferenceValue>`
    - Upon using `getConfigurationSetting`(or add/update), use `parseFeatureFlag` and `parseSecretReference` methods to access the properties(to translate `ConfigurationSetting` into the types above).
    - Helper method `isFeatureFlag` (and `isSecretReference`) checks the contentType and return boolean values.

  ChangelogContent: |-
    - This General Availability (GA) release marks the stability of the changes introduced in package versions 3.1.0-beta.1 through 3.1.0-beta.3.
    - Changed all names including `IdDocument` to use `IdentityDocument` instead, for example: `BeginRecognizeIdentityDocumentOptions`, `beginRecognizeIdentityDocuments`, and `beginRecognizeIdentityDocumentsFromUrl` for clarity.
    - Flattened the `TextStyle` type into the `TextAppearance` type. Rather than having a `style` property with its own `name` and `confidence`, `TextAppearance` now has `styleName` and `styleConfidence` properties.
    - Removed the `FormGenderField` type. Any recognized value that was previously produced as a `FormGenderField` is now returned as a `FormStringField` instead (the `value` will remain the same).
    - Renamed the `FormCountryField` type to `FormCountryRegionField`, and changed the `valueType` discriminant property of that type to `"countryRegion:`.
    - Renamed `ReadingOrder` and `Language` to `FormReadingOrder` and `FormLanguage` to reduce the chance that these types would collide with other types having the same name from other packages.
    - Removed the `KnownStyleName`, `KnownSelectionMarkState`, and `KnownKeyValueType` enums, as they represent simple string enums. The `styleName`, `state`, and `valueType` properties (respectively) now have strong string-enum types.
    - Added the `KnownFormLocale` enum to access the well-known possible values of form locales (the `locale` property of the options parameters for prebuilt model recognition).
    - Migrated to the 2.1 Form Recognizer service endpoint for all REST API calls.

    - Essentially completely rewritten. All existing functionality has been replaced.
    - Removed `policy` property on `AttestationClient` object, because it has been replaced.
    - Removed `policy.reset` and `policy.set`, replaced with the `resetPolicy` and `setPolicy` methods on the `AttestationAdministrationClient`.
    - Removed `policy.get`, replaced with the `getPolicy` method of the new  `AttestationAdministrationClient` client object.
    - Removed `attestation.attestSgxEnclave`, `attestation.attestOpenEnclave`, `attestation.attestTpm`, and `attestation` property from attestationClient, replaced with `attestSgxEnclave`, `attestOpenEnclave` and `attestTpm`.

    - Removed `metadataConfiguration.get()` method, replaced with `client.getOpenIdMetadata()`.
    - Removed `signingCertificates.get()` method, replaced with `client.getAttestationSigners()`. The return value for `getAttestationSigners()` is an array of `AttestationSigner` objects,
    each of which has two properties: `key_id` and `certificates`. `key_id`

    #### New Features

    - Enable encoding the body of a message to the 'value' or 'sequence' sections (via AmqpAnnotatedMessage.bodyType). Using this encoding is not required but does allow you to take advantage of native AMQP serialization for supported primitives or sequences.

    More information about the AMQP message body type can be found in the AMQP specification: [link](https://docs.oasis-open.org/amqp/core/v1.0/os/amqp-core-messaging-v1.0-os.html#section-message-format)

    - Improves cancellation support when sending messages or initializing a connection to the service.

  ChangelogContent: |-
    #### New Features

    - Added support for local cryptography operations. If supported by the key type and algorithm, the `CryptographyClient` will attempt to perform a cryptography operation locally.
    - Added support for symmetric keys in Managed HSMs including support for AES encryption algorithms to encrypt, decrypt, wrap, and unwrap using symmetric keys.
    - Added support for the 7.2 version of the Key Vault service API.

    #### Bug Fixes

    - Fixed a bug with `beginDeleteKey` and `beginRecoverDeletedKey` in which unknown service errors wouldn't bubble up properly to the end users.
    - Fixed bug with the list operations which were returning misplaced properties. Fixes customer issue: [15353](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/issues/15353).
    - Fixed an issue where retrying a failed initial Key Vault request may result in an empty body.

    #### Changes since 4.2.0-beta.5:

    - Removed the now obsolete `KeyOperationsOptions` and replaced it with `CryptographyOptions`.
    - Introduced in 4.2.0-beta.1 to support additional encryption parameters for AES encryption, we have since moved these parameters outside of the options bag so a separate `KeyOperationsOptions` is now redundant.
    - Fixed a bug with `beginDeleteKey` and `beginRecoverDeletedKey` in which unknown service errors wouldn't bubble up properly to the end users.
    - Fixed bug with the list operations which were returning misplaced properties. Fixes customer issue: [15353](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/issues/15353).
    - Exported a method to parse Key Vault Key Ids: `parseKeyVaultKeyIdentifier`.
