    #### Breaking Changes

    - As a result of the migration to Core v2:
    - The response types no longer contain the raw response `_response`. To access the raw response, an `onResponse` callback has to be passed in the request options bag, for example:
    ```ts
    let rawResponse: FullOperationResponse | undefined;
    await client.operationName(/* ...parameters... */, {
    onResponse: (response) => (rawResponse = response),
    });
    ```
    - The re-export of the `PipelineOptions` type from `@azure/core-http` has been removed. If you previously relied on this export, consider either using the more specific `CertificateClientOptions` type or importing `PipelineOptions` from `@azure/core-http` directly.

    #### Features Added
    - Added support for new credential `ClientAssertionCredential`, which accepts a callback function for the signed JWT assertion for a client certificate. See [MSAL Client Assertion for more information](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/blob/dev/lib/msal-node/docs/initialize-confidential-client-application.md).

    #### Bugs Fixed

    - Fixed a bug that would break the AzureCliCredential if the Azure CLI reported a warning. See: [21075](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/issues/21075).
    - Fixed a bug in `AuthorizationCodeCredential` where the tenant id was not being used. The `common` tenant was the only tenant being used by this credential.
    - Fixed a bug in `AuthorizationCodeCredential` where the public client was not being used. Due to this bug, without passing in the client secret, this credential would fail.
    - Fixed a bug in `DefaultAzureCredential` and `AzureCLICredential` where the errors thrown by the latter credential were not of type `CredentialUnavailableError`. This caused only the error of `AzureCLICredential` being thrown and the other chained errors of `DefaultAzureCredential` were not thrown. See: [22066](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/issues/22066)
