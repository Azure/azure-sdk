    #### Features Added
    - Added support for new credential `ClientAssertionCredential`, which accepts a callback function for the signed JWT assertion for a client certificate. See [MSAL Client Assertion for more information](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/blob/dev/lib/msal-node/docs/initialize-confidential-client-application.md).

    #### Bugs Fixed

    - Fixed a bug that would break the AzureCliCredential if the Azure CLI reported a warning. See: [21075](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/issues/21075).
    - Fixed a bug in `AuthorizationCodeCredential` where the tenant id was not being used. The `common` tenant was the only tenant being used by this credential.
    - Fixed a bug in `AuthorizationCodeCredential` where the public client was not being used. Due to this bug, without passing in the client secret, this credential would fail.
    - Fixed a bug in `DefaultAzureCredential` and `AzureCLICredential` where the errors thrown by the latter credential were not of type `CredentialUnavailableError`. This caused only the error of `AzureCLICredential` being thrown and the other chained errors of `DefaultAzureCredential` were not thrown.

    #### Breaking Changes

    - As a result of the migration to Core v2:
    - The response types no longer contain the raw response `_response`. To access the raw response, an `onResponse` callback has to be passed in the request options bag, for example:
    ```ts
    let rawResponse: FullOperationResponse | undefined;
    await client.operationName(/* ...parameters... */, {
    onResponse: (response) => (rawResponse = response),
    });
    ```
    - The re-export of the `PipelineOptions` type from `@azure/core-http` has been removed. If you previously relied on this export, consider either using the more specific `SecretClientOptions` type or importing `PipelineOptions` from `@azure/core-http` directly.

    #### Features Added

    - Refactored generic `DocumentModel` support to be more robust to different kinds of models. It now supports strongly-typed results for `prebuilt-read`, `prebuilt-layout`, and `prebuilt-document`. See the "Breaking Changes" section for more information about how to replace existing usage of `PrebuiltModels` with new model code.
    - `DocumentModelAdministrationClient#getOperation` returns additional `result` (operation result) and `error` (includes detailed error info) fields.

    #### Breaking Changes

    - Removed `PrebuiltModels` and all of its fields as well as related helper types. The strongly-typed functionality previously provided by `PrebuiltModels` is now provided by sample code that you can copy into your own project. See the [`prebuilt` samples directory](https://github.com/azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/main/sdk/formrecognizer/ai-form-recognizer/samples-dev/prebuilt/) for models compatible with the current Form Recognizer API.
    - Separated URL-based and file-based analysis inputs into two separate methods: `beginAnalyzeDocument` (for file stream inputs) and `beginAnalyzeDocumentFromUrl` (for URL-based inputs). Previously, both were accepted as inputs to a single `beginAnalyzeDocument` method, and a string value would be interpreted as if it were a URL, but this was confusing. The two inputs now have distinct signatures and documentation.
    - Removed the `beginExtractLayout`, `beginExtractGeneralDocument`, and `beginReadDocument` methods. Strongly-typed `DocumentModel` instances for the corresponding `prebuilt-layout`, `prebuilt-document`, and `prebuilt-read` models are located in the [`prebuilt` samples directory](https://github.com/azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/main/sdk/formrecognizer/ai-form-recognizer/samples-dev/prebuilt/).
    - Changed the suffix `-Info` for the methods and interfaces such as `DocumentModelAdministrationClient#getResourceInfo` and `DocumentModelInfo` to `-Details`.
    - Array properties of `AnalyzeResult`, such as `documents`, `languages`, and `pages` are now optional. If the value is `undefined`, then the model does not support the given feature. Previously, we returned an empty array, even if the model didn't support the feature.

    #### Breaking Changes

    - Migrated to the Core v2 HTTP pipeline. As a result of this migration:
    - The response types no longer contain the raw response `_response`. To access the raw response, an `onResponse` callback has to be passed in the request options bag, for example:
    ```ts
    let rawResponse: FullOperationResponse | undefined;
    await client.operationName(/* ...parameters... */, {
    onResponse: (response) => (rawResponse = response),
    });
    ```
    - The re-export of the `PipelineOptions` type from `@azure/core-http` has been removed. If you previously relied on this export, consider either using the more specific `SecretClientOptions` type or importing `PipelineOptions` from `@azure/core-http` directly.
