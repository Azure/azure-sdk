    #### Features Added

    - **Initial release** of `azure-monitor-querymetrics` package with core Azure Monitor metrics querying functionality.
    - Includes the `MetricsClient` for querying metrics from Azure Monitor resources.

    **Migration from azure-monitor-query**

    This package extracts the metrics functionality from the `azure-monitor-query` package to provide a focused solution for metrics querying.

    **For existing users of `MetricsClient`:**
    - Migration is straightforward - only import paths need to be updated.
    - The API surface remains unchanged.
    - **Before:** `from azure.monitor.query import MetricsClient`
    - **After:** `from azure.monitor.querymetrics import MetricsClient`

    **For users of `MetricsQueryClient`:**
    - This functionality is **not included** in this package.
    - **Recommended alternative:** Use `MonitorManagementClient` from the `azure-mgmt-monitor` package.
    - The management client provides comprehensive Azure Monitor resource management capabilities.

    For more details, see the [migration guide](https://aka.ms/azsdk/python/monitor/query/migration).

    - Fixed an issue where the package version in operation user agent strings was always set to "unknown" instead of the actual package version. ([#39866](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/pull/39866))

    #### Breaking Changes

    - `MetricsClient` and `MetricsQueryClient` have been removed from the `azure-monitor-query` package. This is part of the migration to split logs and metrics functionality into separate packages.  ([#42205](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/pull/42205))
    - The `MetricsClient` has been moved to the new `azure-monitor-querymetrics` package.
    - Functionality provided by `MetricsQueryClient` can be access through the `azure-mgmt-monitor` package.

    #### Breaking changes

    * Features that are still in preview were removed from this stable release. This includes:
    * Evaluation operations (property `.evaluations`)
    * Red-Team operations (property `.red_teams`)
    * Class `PromptTemplate`.

    * Class `SasCredential` was renamed `BlobReferenceSasCredential`
    * Class `AssetCredentialResponse` was renamed `DatasetCredential`
    * Method `.inference.get_azure_openai_client()` was renamed `.get_openai_client()`. The `.inference` property was removed.
    The method is documented as returning an object of type `OpenAI`, but it still returns an object of the derived type `AzureOpenAI`.
    The function implementation has not changed.

  ChangelogContent: |-
    #### Breaking Changes

    - Added `evaluate_query` parameter to all RAI service evaluators that can be passed as a keyword argument. This parameter controls whether queries are included in evaluation data when evaluating query-response pairs. Previously, queries were always included in evaluations. When set to `True`, both query and response will be evaluated; when set to `False` (default), only the response will be evaluated. This parameter is available across all RAI service evaluators including `ContentSafetyEvaluator`, `ViolenceEvaluator`, `SexualEvaluator`, `SelfHarmEvaluator`, `HateUnfairnessEvaluator`, `ProtectedMaterialEvaluator`, `IndirectAttackEvaluator`, `CodeVulnerabilityEvaluator`, `UngroundedAttributesEvaluator`, `GroundednessProEvaluator`, and `EciEvaluator`.  Existing code that relies on queries being evaluated will need to explicitly set `evaluate_query=True` to maintain the previous behavior.

    #### Bugs Fixed

    - Fixed red team scan `output_path` issue where individual evaluation results were overwriting each other instead of being preserved as separate files. Individual evaluations now create unique files while the user's `output_path` is reserved for final aggregated results.
    - Significant improvements to TaskAdherence evaluator. New version has less variance, is much faster and consumes fewer tokens.
    - Significant improvements to Relevance evaluator. New version has more concrete rubrics and has less variance, is much faster and consumes fewer tokens.


    #### Features Added

    - Added support for Azure OpenAI Python grader via `AzureOpenAIPythonGrader` class, which serves as a wrapper around Azure Open AI Python grader configurations. This new grader object can be supplied to the main `evaluate` method as if it were a normal callable evaluator.
    - Added `attack_success_thresholds` parameter to `RedTeam` class for configuring custom thresholds that determine attack success. This allows users to set specific threshold values for each risk category, with scores greater than the threshold considered successful attacks (i.e. higher threshold means higher
    tolerance for harmful responses).
    - Enhanced threshold reporting in RedTeam results to include default threshold values when custom thresholds aren't specified, providing better transparency about the evaluation criteria used.

    #### Breaking Changes
    - **Version Lineage Change**: This stable release is based on `1.0.2` and does not include the experimental features that were introduced in the beta versions `1.1.0b1` through `1.1.0b5`. This means that any beta-specific functionality you may have been using is not available in this stable release.
    - **Migration Path**: If you need to continue using the experimental features from the beta releases, please upgrade to `1.2.0b1` which continues the beta feature development line.

    #### Bugs Fixed

    - `_AgentsClientOperationsMixin` is now private.

    #### Features Added

    - Support `tool_resources` for run async operations.

    #### Breaking Changes
    - **Version Lineage Change**: This beta release continues the experimental feature development from `1.1.0b4`, adding new functionality and improvements.
    - **Important Version Context**: The stable release `1.1.0` is based on `1.0.2` and does not include beta features. This `1.2.0b1` beta release preserves and extends all experimental features from the `1.1.0b1`-`1.1.0b4` beta series.

    #### Bugs Fixed

    - `AgentsResponseFormatOption`, `MessageInputContent`, `MessageAttachmentToolDefinition`, `AgentsToolChoiceOption` are now public.
    - Fixed issues where the `runs.create_and_process` API call did not correctly handle the `AzureAISearchTool`, `FileSearchTool`, and `CodeInterpreterTool` when specified in the toolset parameter.
    - Fixed `update_agent` to execute with body as a keyword parameter.
