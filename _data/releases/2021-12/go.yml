    #### Breaking Changes

    - AdminClient has been moved into the `admin` subpackage.
    - ReceivedMessage.Body is now a function that returns a ([]byte, error), rather than being a field.
    This protects against a potential data-loss scenario where a message is received with a payload
    encoded in the sequence or value sections of an AMQP message, which cannot be prpoerly represented
    in the .Body. This will now return an error.
    - Functions that have options or might have options in the future have an additional *options parameter.
    As usual, passing 'nil' ignores the options, and will cause the function to use defaults.
    - MessageBatch.Add() has been renamed to MessageBatch.AddMessage(). AddMessage() now returns only an `error`,
    with a sentinel error (ErrMessageTooLarge) signaling that the batch cannot fit a new message.
    - Sender.SendMessages() has been removed in favor of simplifications made in MessageBatch.

    #### Bugs Fixed

    - ReceiveMessages has been tuned to match the .NET limits (which has worked well in practice). This partly addresses #15963,
    as our default limit was far higher than needed.

    #### Features Added

    - AbandonMessage and DeferMessage now take an additional `PropertiesToModify` option, allowing
    the message properties to be modified when they are settled.
    - Missing fields for entities in the admin.Client have been added (UserMetadata, etc..)
