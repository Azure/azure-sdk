    #### Features Added
    - The call extended features now are accessed but the `feature` method call instead of the `api` like previous versions. Also, you can leverage the class `Features` to obtain the list of available features like `Features.RECORDING` and `Features.TRANSCRIPTION`. Classes `RecordingFeature` and `TranscriptionFeature` have been renamed to `RecordingCallFeature` and `TranscriptionCallFeature`. More information on [Record Calls](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/how-tos/calling-sdk/record-calls?pivots=platform-android#record-calls) and [Show Transcription state](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/how-tos/calling-sdk/call-transcription?pivots=platform-android)

    - New API to initialize `CallClient` with `CallClientOptions` with property `DiagnosticOptions` with properties `appName`, `appVersion` and `tags` for telemetry purposes to identify which Application is using the SDK.

    #### Bugs fixed
    - Fix for crash when user inputs an invalid teams meeting link. [GH#198](https://github.com/Azure/Communication/issues/198)
    - Fix for `CallAgent` and `CallClient` dispose methods takes too long to execute. [GH#358](https://github.com/Azure/Communication/issues/358) and [GH#339](https://github.com/Azure/Communication/issues/339)
    - Fix for when camera preview is rotating even if the app supports only portrait mode. [GH#338](https://github.com/Azure/Communication/issues/338)
    - Fix for the event `didUpdateRemoteParticipant` event not firing sometimes when `call.AddParticipant` API is called by the application.
    - Fix when the camera switch button is pressed several times, the preview of the client's camera can be blocked.
    - Fix for a freeze when mute/unmute is done when `inLobby` in a Teams call. [GH#276](https://github.com/Azure/Communication/issues/276)
    - Fix for the warning displayed in XCode when importing the SDK, `arm64-apple-ios.swiftsourceinfo either malformed or generated by a different Swift version`.
    - Fix for crash when signing out and signing in repeatedly.


    #### Breaking Changes
    1. `Call.addParticipant` API is now a throwable type when trying to add a participant that is already to the call or when a participant is added to an unconnected call.
