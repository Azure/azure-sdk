    #### Bugs Fixed

    - Fixed bug in WinHTTP client which caused the `IgnoreUnknownCertificateAuthority` and `EnableCertificateRevocationListCheck` fields to be ignored if they were passed in from `TransportOptions`.
    - [[#4206]](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-cpp/issues/4206) Fixed connectivity issues in libcurl HTTP transport which can occur if a TCP connection is dropped prematurely. (A community contribution, courtesy of _[ahojnnes](https://github.com/ahojnnes)_)

    #### Features Added

    - Added support for parsing space character in place of 'T' in RFC3339 DateTimes.
    - Added support for HTTP proxy servers, both unauthenticated and with basic authentication.
    - Added universal support for several TLS options:
    - Added the ability to set the expected TLS root certificate for TLS connection (useful if a proxy server uses a TLS certificate that is not chained to a known root).
    - Added the ability to enable TLS certificate revocation list checks (off by default).
    - For libcurl only: Allow TLS connection to succeed if CRL retrieval fails.
    - *NOTE*: This change only applies if libcurl is built using the OpenSSL crypto backend. It does NOT apply if libcurl uses the schannel (Windows default) or SecureTransport (macOS/iOS default).

    #### Breaking Changes

    - Changed the name of several distributed tracing HTTP span attributes:
    - `requestId` is renamed to `az.client_request_id`
    - `serviceRequestId` is renamed to `az.service_request_id`

    - Bearer token authentication will not work for endpoint URL protocol schemes other than `"https"`. This ensures token security and is consistent with the Azure SDKs for other languages.

    - Removed `noexcept` specification from `Azure::DateTime::clock::now()`.

    - Updated retry policy timeouts to conform to Azure guidelines.
    - The default delay between retries is changed from 4 seconds to 800ms.
    - The maximum retry delay is changed from 2 minutes to 60 seconds (one minute).

    If the original behavior is desired, customers can adjust these timeouts by changing the `RetryDelay` and `MaxRetryDelay` fields in the `RetryOptions` structure.
