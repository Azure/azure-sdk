    #### Breaking Changes

    - `AmqpClaimsBasedSecurity` now takes ownership of the associated session rather than simply referencing the associated session. This means that all CBS authentication operations should be performed on dedicated AmqpSession objects.

    - `AmqpOrderedMap::iter` now iterates over references to key and value, not clones of the key and value, thus eliminating unnecessary clones.

    #### Features Added

    - Added `#[safe]` attribute helper for `SafeDebug` derive macro to show or hide types and members as appropriate.
    - Added module `fmt::as_string` which is used to (de)serialize types in string format.
    - Added `Response<T, F>` type to represent a response with a specific format and model type.
    - Added `RawResponse` type to represent a raw response without a specific model.

    #### Breaking Changes

    - Removed the `Model` trait and replaced it with `Response<T, F>`, which moves the "format" information (JSON/XML/etc.) from the model to the service client method's return type. This allows for more flexibility in handling different response formats and user data types in Responses.
    - Split `Response` into `Response<T, F>` and `RawResponse` (which carries the raw response data without a specific format).

    #### Features Added

    - Added `#[safe]` attribute helper for `SafeDebug` derive macro to show or hide types and members as appropriate.
    - Added `Page` trait to facilitate the `ItemIterator`.

    #### Bugs Fixed

    - Removed `AccessToken::is_expired()`.
    - Renamed `PagerResult::Continue` to `More` and its `continuation` field to `next`.
    - Renamed `PagerResult::Complete` to `Done`.
