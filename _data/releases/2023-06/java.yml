    * Added `CosmosContainerProactiveInitConfigBuilder:setAggressiveWarmupDuration(Duration aggressiveWarmupDuration)` public API to switch between aggressively opening connections

    #### Bugs Fixed

    - Fixed issue where receiving messages from `ServiceBusSessionReceiverAsyncClient` would never complete. ([#34597](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/issues/34597))
    - Fixed issue causing some messages to not be returned when calling peek on receiver client.
    - Fixed the issue of `ServiceBusReceiverClient` recreating the link after closing the client. ([#34664](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/issues/34664))
    - Fixed a race condition in `ServiceBusReceiverClient` sometimes causing two requests to be sent when peeking or receiving deferred messages.
    ([#34838](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/issues/34838))
    - Fixed tracing for renew-lock operation, now it traces individual calls to the broker instead local long-running operation.

    #### Features Added

    - Added `sessionIdleTimeout` method to configure session idle timeout on `ServiceBusSessionProcessorClientBuilder`. After this time has elapsed,
    the processor will close the session and attempt to process another session. ([#34700](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/issues/34700))
