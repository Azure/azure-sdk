  ChangelogContent: |-
    #### Features Added
    - Added new constructor with required param `tokenRefresher` for `CommunicationTokenRefreshOptions`
    - Deprecated old constructor overloads in `CommunicationTokenRefreshOptions` and replaced by fluent setters
    - Added fluent setters for optional properties:
    - Added `setRefreshProactively(boolean refreshProactively)` setter that allows setting whether the token should be proactively renewed prior to its expiry or on demand.
    - Added `setInitialToken(String initialToken)` setter that allows setting the optional serialized JWT token
    - Optimization added: When the proactive refreshing is enabled and the token refresher fails to provide a token that's not about to expire soon, the subsequent refresh attempts will be scheduled for when the token reaches half of its remaining lifetime until a token with long enough validity (>10 minutes) is obtained.
    - The default `CommunicationCloudEnvironment` constructor will create Azure public cloud.
    - Overrode the `equals`, `toString`, `hashCode` methods of `CommunicationCloudEnvironment` to make it consistent with Java API.

    #### Breaking Changes
    - Introduced non-nullability check for the argument of `CommunicationCloudEnvironment.fromString(String name)`. It will throw `NullPointerException` if the passed argument is null.
