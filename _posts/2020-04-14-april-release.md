Welcome to the April release of the Azure SDK.  We have updated the following libraries:

* App Configuration
* Event Hubs
* Key Vault
* Storage

These are ready to use in your production applications.  You can find details of all released libraries on [our releases page](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/releases/latest/).

New preview releases:

* Cognitive Search
* Event Hubs
* Service Bus (New!)
* Text Analytics

In addition, there is a new preview release for Azure Identity, which features improvements to the `DefaultAzureCredential` to better support common developer workflows.

We believe these are ready for you to use and experiment with, but not yet ready for production.  Between now and the GA release, these libraries may undergo API changes.  We'd love your feedback!  If you use these libraries and like what you see, or you want to see changes, let us know in GitHub issues.
