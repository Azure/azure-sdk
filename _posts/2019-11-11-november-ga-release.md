The Azure SDK team is pleased to announce the Novemeber 2019 release of the Azure client libraries.  We have some libraries that have reached General Availability and others that we have provided a new preview.

The following libraries have reached our general availability level.  This requires support from all four languages (.NET, Java, Python, and TypeScript).

* Key Vault (Keys, Secrets)
* Storage (Blobs, Queues)

In addition, we have made the Azure Core and Identity libraries generally available.

We also updated the following libraries with a new preview:

* App Configuration
* Cosmos
* Event Hubs
* KeyVault (Certificates)
* Storage (File Shares)

We recommend that you use the generally available client libraries for all new projects, and consider upgrading existing projects to use the new libraries as time permits.

We also encourage you to try out the new previews and give us your feedback by opening an issue on the appropriate GitHub repository.

You can find all the details in our release notes for each language:
