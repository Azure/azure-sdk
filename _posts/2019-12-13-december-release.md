The Azure SDK team is pleased to announce the December 2019 release of the Azure client libraries.  We have some libraries that have reached General Availability and others that we have provided a new preview.

The following libraries have reached our general availability level.  This requires support from all four languages (.NET, Java, Python, and JavaScript).

* Storage Files (SMB and other file shares)

We also updated the following libraries with a new preview:

* App Configuration
* Cosmos
* Event Hubs
* KeyVault Certificates
* Storage DataLake Files

You can find a complete list of all our SDK packages here: https://aka.ms/sdkrel

We recommend that you use the generally available client libraries for all new projects, and consider upgrading existing projects to use the new libraries as time permits.

We are always looking for developer feedback. When you have feedback, open an issue on the GitHub repository for the language of the library you're using.

You can find all the details in our release notes for each language:

* [.NET release notes]({{site.baseurl}}/releases/2019-12/dotnet.html)
