Ever wondered the evolution of computer-assisted data entry and how it slowly took away the need for manual intervention in data entry procedures?

As part of this digital transformation, the customers soon felt a need to have an AI solution to automate and reduce the cost of converting paper/digital documents (invoices, receipts, business cards, etc.) into structured data for further processing and hence, Azure Form Recognizer. Azure Form Recognizer is an AI-powered document extraction cognitive service that uses machine learning technology to identify and extract key-value pairs and table data from form documents. It outputs recognized structured data and includes the relationships between the various fields in the original file.
Applications of Form Recognizer service can seem to extend beyond just assiting with data entry. Form recognizer could also offer integrated solutions for optimizing the auditing needs of customer to aid them in making informed business decisions by learning from their expense trends or aiding with document matching for platforms dealing with digital records.

Lets take an example to understand how a customer might want to use Form Recognizer Azure service to populate expense fields from receipt url as part of an expense maintianing data entry app.

The expense data entry app user, would need to provide a receipt Url for which they want to recognize the relevant expense field information. This could be a web app using Form Recognizer Azure SDK library internally. The underlying SDK client library then feeds this document Url to the [Form Recognizer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/form-recognizer/) service. Let's see some code on how the app might want to use this library. Although you can use any of our languages for this ([.NET](https://github.com/azure/azure-sdk-for-net), [Python](https://github.com/azure/azure-sdk-for-python), [Java](https://github.com/azure/azure-sdk-for-java), or [JavaScript/TypeScript](https://github.com/azure/azure-sdk-for-js)), we will be using Java for the examples today.

## Recognize expense fields from receipt

The Form Recognizer recognize receipt API includes a pretrained model for reading English sales receipts from the United States â€” the type used by restaurants, gas stations, retail. This model has already being trained to extract expense related key information such as the time and date of the transaction, merchant information, amounts of taxes and totals and more. In addition, the prebuilt receipt model is trained to recognize and return all of the text on a receipt.

```java
public class AnalyzeDataApp {
  // Create a formRecognizerClient
  private final FormRecognizerClient formRecognizerClient;

  public AnalyzeDataApp(String apiKey, String endpoint) {
    // Authenticate the client with valid endpoint and API key
    this.formRecognizerClient = new FormRecognizerClientBuilder()
      .credential(new AzureKeyCredential(apiKey)))
      .endpoint(endpoint)
      .buildAsyncClient();
  }
}
```
Let's create a method that exports/prints out the recognized receipt information.

```java
  public recognizeExpenseFields(String receiptUrl) {
    // Use the receiptUrl provided by the user
    SyncPoller<OperationResult, IterableStream<RecognizedReceipt>> recognizeReceiptPoller = this.formRecognizerClient.beginRecognizeReceiptsFromUrl(receiptUrl);
    // Wait for the poller to complete and get the final result
    IterableStream<RecognizedReceipt> receiptPageResults = recognizeReceiptPoller.getFinalResult();

    // Iterate over each page of the receipt
    receiptPageResults.forEach(recognizedReceipt -> {
      System.out.println("----------- Recognized Receipt -----------");
      // Get the receipt information for a US Receipt  
      USReceipt usReceipt = ReceiptExtensions.asUSReceipt(recognizedReceipt);
      System.out.printf("Merchant Name: %s, confidence: %.2f%n", usReceipt.getMerchantName().getFieldValue(), usReceipt.getMerchantName().getConfidence());
      System.out.printf("Merchant Address: %s, confidence: %.2f%n", usReceipt.getMerchantAddress().getName(), usReceipt.getMerchantAddress().getConfidence());
      // Each extracted value is returned with a confidence value, to highlight specific ones that might need more attention
      System.out.printf("Merchant Phone Number %s, confidence: %.2f%n", usReceipt.getMerchantPhoneNumber().getFieldValue(), usReceipt.getMerchantPhoneNumber().getConfidence());
      System.out.printf("Total: %s confidence: %.2f%n", usReceipt.getTotal().getName(), usReceipt.getTotal().getConfidence());
      // Get hold of the itemized data, if present
      System.out.printf("Receipt Items: %n");
      usReceipt.getReceiptItems().forEach(receiptItem -> {
        if (receiptItem.getName() != null) {
            System.out.printf("Name: %s, confidence: %.2f%n", receiptItem.getName().getFieldValue(), receiptItem.getName().getConfidence());
        }
        if (receiptItem.getQuantity() != null) {
            System.out.printf("Quantity: %s, confidence: %.2f%n", receiptItem.getQuantity().getFieldValue(), receiptItem.getQuantity().getConfidence());
        }
        if (receiptItem.getPrice() != null) {
            System.out.printf("Price: %s, confidence: %.2f%n", receiptItem.getPrice().getFieldValue(), receiptItem.getPrice().getConfidence());
        }
        if (receiptItem.getTotalPrice() != null) {
            System.out.printf("Total Price: %s, confidence: %.2f%n", receiptItem.getTotalPrice().getFieldValue(), receiptItem.getTotalPrice().getConfidence());
        }
      });
      System.out.print("-----------------------------------");
    });
  }
```

Further, to help the customers with additional manual validation steps the API could return raw bounding box information to highlight the location of the recognized expense fields. Much advanced integrated solutions could be built by using this library, to handle specific solution requirements of the customer.
Let's now look at example how a customer might want to use this library for interpreting form document data into usable structured data.

## Recognize text and layout information using the Form Recognizer

Form Recognizer can also extract text and table structure (the row and column numbers associated with the text) using high-definition optical character recognition (OCR). The resultant data contains each line of text and its corresponding bounding box placement on the form page document. It also returns the tabular data found on page with each of the cell field information with its corresponding row-column coordinate.

Let's create a method that exports/prints out the recognized layout information.

```java
  public recognizeFormTextLayout() {
    // Use the formUrl provided by the user
    SyncPoller<OperationResult, IterableStream<FormPage>> recognizeContentPoller = this.formRecognizerClient.beginRecognizeContent(formUrl);
    // Wait for the poller to complete and get the final result
    IterableStream<FormPage> contentPageResults = recognizeLayoutPoller.getFinalResult();

    // Iterate over each page of the form
    contentPageResults.forEach(formPage -> {
      // Display the page metdata
      System.out.println("----Recognizing content ----");
      System.out.printf("The form page has width: %s and height: %s, measured with unit: %s%n", 
        formPage.getWidth(),
        formPage.getHeight(),
        formPage.getUnit());
      // Display recognized table information from the form  
      formPage.getTables().forEach(formTable -> {
        System.out.printf("The recognized table has %s rows and %s columns.%n", 
          formTable.getRowCount(),
          formTable.getColumnCount());
        formTable.getCells().forEach(formTableCell -> {
          final StringBuilder boundingBoxInfo = new StringBuilder();
          if (formTableCell.getBoundingBox() != null) {
            formTableCell.getBoundingBox().getPoints().forEach(point ->
              boundingBoxInfo.append(String.format("[%.2f, %.2f]", point.getX(), point.getY())));
          }
          // Each cell text data with corresponding box information
          System.out.printf("this cell has text %s, within bounding box %s.%n", formTableCell.getText(),
            boundingBoxInfo);
        });
        System.out.println();
      });
    });
  }
```

The Form Recognizer client library, can further be extended to provide completely customized and tailored data. It allows users to train models using their own data forms and then use those trained models for recognizing customized forms!
To do this, the user first needs to provide a set of five input forms (minimum) that they would want to use for training the model. 
The custom training model API's additionally provide the user a convenience of training the models with or without labeled data. 

## Custom model training with Labels
Custom models built using labeled data, does supervised learning to recognize keys/value pairs of special interest to the user. This is done by using the labeled data information provided by the user. The process of labeling of data undergoes steps of creating tags/labels for text elements that you would want the model to recognize more explicitly. Look for the [OCR Form Labeling Tool](https://github.com/microsoft/OCR-Form-Tools/blob/master/README.md#run-as-web-application) open source project on github to assist you with labeling of your forms. Learn more about setting up the input data required for training with labels [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/form-recognizer/quickstarts/python-labeled-data#set-up-training-data). The returned customized model results in better-suited model for recognizing the custom form at hand and further can be used to produce models for more complex forms.
Let's see an example of how to train a custom model using labeled data and recognize a form using that model.

```java
  public recognizeFormTextLayout(String trainingFilesUrl, String analyzeFileUrl) {

    // Get a FormTrainingClient from FormRecognizerClient
    FormTrainingClient formTrainingClient = this.formRecognizerClient.getFormTrainingClient();

    // Set to true to use labeled data when training
    boolean useTrainingLabels = true;
    SyncPoller<OperationResult, CustomFormModel> trainingPoller = formTrainingClient.beginTraining(trainingFilesUrl, useTrainingLabels);

    // Wait for the poller to complete and get the final result
    CustomFormModel customFormModel = trainingPoller.getFinalResult();

    // Model Info
    System.out.printf("Model Id: %s%n", customFormModel.getModelId());
    System.out.printf("Model Status: %s%n", customFormModel.getModelStatus());
    // Since the data is labeled, we are able to return the accuracy of the model
    customFormModel.getSubModels().forEach(customFormSubModel -> {
      // Improve model accuracy by labeling additional forms 
      System.out.printf("Sub-model accuracy: %.2f%n", customFormSubModel.getAccuracy());
    });
    
    // Use the above custom trained model 
    String modelId = customFormModel.getModelId();
    SyncPoller<OperationResult, IterableStream<RecognizedForm>> recognizeFormPoller = this.formRecognizerClient.beginRecognizeCustomFormsFromUrl(analyzeFileUrl,       modelId);

    // Wait for the poller to complete and get the final result
    IterableStream<RecognizedForm> recognizedForms = recognizeFormPoller.getFinalResult();

    // Iterate over each page of the form
    recognizedForms.forEach(form -> {
      System.out.println("----------- Recognized Form -----------");
      form.getFields().forEach((label, formField) -> {
        // examine the confidence values for each of the applied tags in the labeling process
        System.out.printf("Field %s has value %s with confidence score of %.2f.%n", 
          label,
          formField.getFieldValue(),
          formField.getConfidence());
      });
      System.out.print("-----------------------------------");
    });
  }
```
## Custom model training without Labels
This feature allows customers to submit their input forms, without requiring labeling process steps. The underlying algorithm clusters the forms by type, discovers what keys and tables are present, and associates values to keys and entries to tables.

The API differentiates unlabeled and labeled training of models with the presence of boolean parameter `useTrainingLabels` If `useTrainingLabels = false` the `beginTraining` API performs model training without labels.

## Managing your Cognitive Services Account
The SDK client library for Form Recognizer additionally offers customers with API's to learn more about their Cognitive services account. Users can manage their account by getting subscription account information or can dive into specifics for a particular model or even delete a model if no longer needed!

Let's see a code example of how this looks:

```java
  public manageCustomModels() {

    // Get a FormTrainingClient from FormRecognizerClient
    FormTrainingClient formTrainingClient = this.formRecognizerClient.getFormTrainingClient();

    // First, we see how many custom models we have, and what our model limit is for this account
    AccountProperties accountProperties = client.getAccountProperties();
    System.out.printf("The account has %s custom models, and we can have at most %s custom models",
        accountProperties.getCustomModelCount(), accountProperties.getCustomModelLimit());

    // Next, we get a paged list of all of our custom models
    PagedIterable<CustomFormModelInfo> customModels = client.getModelInfos();
    System.out.println("We have following models in the account:");
    customModels.forEach(customFormModelInfo -> {
        System.out.printf("Model Id: %s%n", customFormModelInfo.getModelId());
        modelId.set(customFormModelInfo.getModelId());
        // get custom model info for each of the listed models
        CustomFormModel customModel = client.getCustomModel(customFormModelInfo.getModelId());
        System.out.printf("Model Id: %s%n", customModel.getModelId());
        System.out.printf("Model Status: %s%n", customModel.getModelStatus());
        System.out.printf("Created on: %s%n", customModel.getCreatedOn());
        System.out.printf("Updated on: %s%n", customModel.getLastUpdatedOn());
        customModel.getSubModels().forEach(customFormSubModel -> {
            System.out.printf("Custom Model Form type: %s%n", customFormSubModel.getFormType());
            System.out.printf("Custom Model Accuracy: %.2f%n", customFormSubModel.getAccuracy());
            if (customFormSubModel.getFieldMap() != null) {
                customFormSubModel.getFieldMap().forEach((fieldText, customFormModelField) -> {
                    System.out.printf("Field Text: %s%n", fieldText);
                    System.out.printf("Field Accuracy: %.2f%n", customFormModelField.getAccuracy());
                });
            }

        });
    });
    
    // Delete a Custom Model
    System.out.printf("Deleted model with model Id: %s operation completed with status: %s%n", modelId.get(),
        client.deleteModelWithResponse(modelId.get(), Context.NONE).getStatusCode());
  }
```

## Coming up
Stay tuned for the June release of the Azure SDK as it would add:
- Support for Copy Custom Model API
  Now the customers, can further share and copy their custom models between regions and subscriptions using the new Copy Custom Model feature.
