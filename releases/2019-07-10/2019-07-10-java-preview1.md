## Changelog
Detailed change logs are linked to in the Quick Links below. Here are some critical call outs.

* Designed based on the [Azure SDK Design Guidelines for Java][java-guidelines], resulting in a consistent API design and common feature set such as HTTP retries, logging, transport protocols, authentication protocols, etc.
* Modernized API making use of Java 8 features such as streams, new date / time, functional interfaces, etc, to offer an improved and more productive developer experience.
* Synchronous and asynchronous APIs offer developers simplicity for simple cases, and full asynchronousity when performance and scalability matters. Reactive streams are offered using [Project Reactor](http://projectreactor.io).
