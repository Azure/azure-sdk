## Changelog
Detailed change logs are linked to in the Quick Links below. Here are some critical call outs.

- Designed based on the [Azure SDK Design Guidelines for Typescript][typescript-guidelines], resulting in a consistent API design and common feature set such as HTTP retries, logging, transport protocols, authentication protocols, cancellation mechanisms etc.
- Support for Azure Active Directory credentials created using the new [@azure/identity](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/identity) library. Moving forward, this would be the common mode of authentication for all Azure SDK libraries.
- Modernized API making use of async functions and async iterators, to offer an improved and more productive developer experience.
