### Text Analytics [Changelog](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/master/sdk/textanalytics/azure-ai-textanalytics/CHANGELOG.md#change-log-azure-ai-textanalytics)

- We are no longer supporting the `recognize_pii_entities` endpoint for this release
- We are removing `TextAnalyticsApiKeyCredential` and are now using `AzureKeyCredential` from azure.core.credentials as our API key credential.

### Service Bus [Changelog](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/master/sdk/servicebus/azure-servicebus/CHANGELOG.md)

- This release simplifies the client hierarchy and many common flows, such as spawning senders and receivers directly from the `ServiceBusClient`.  Recommend reading migration guide and full changelog for details.
- Support for Azure Identity based authentication.
- Exception hierarchy has been overhauled and made more precise to better denote failure reasons.
- Batch creation is now initiated off of the sender via `create_batch`.
- Users should be aware that this is a preview release with only support for queues, full featureset will be included in upcoming previews.

### Event Hubs [Changelog](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/master/sdk/eventhub/azure-eventhub/CHANGELOG.md)

- Added `EventHubConsumerClient.receive_batch()` to receive and process events in batches instead of one by one. #9184
- `EventHubConsumerCliuent.receive()` has a new param `max_wait_time`.
`on_event` is called every `max_wait_time` when no events are received and `max_wait_time` is not `None` or 0.
- Param event of `PartitionContext.update_checkpoint` is now optional. The last received event is used when param event is not passed in.
- `EventData.system_properties` has added missing properties when consuming messages from IotHub. #10408
