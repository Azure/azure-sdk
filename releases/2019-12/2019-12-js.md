## Changelog
Detailed change logs are linked to in the Quick Links below. Here are some critical call outs.

### Keyvault

While the `@azure/keyvault-keys` and `@azure/keyvault-secrets` packages have had their API reference documentation updated,
the `@azure/keyvault-certificates` package has another preview shipped with a set of API updates to align itself across languages.

### Storage

While the `@azure/storage-blob` and `@azure/storage-queue` packages have had their API reference documentation updated, 
and a few bugs fixed, the new `@azure/storage-file-share` package has moved from preview to stable stage.
Please note that this package replaces the previous `@azure/storage-file` package.

### Event Hubs

The latest preview for the `@azure/event-hubs` package has built on top of the previous preview with slight API improvements
across the board. If you have been using the `@azure/eventhubs-checkpointstore-blob` package 
to take advantage of the load balancing and checkpointing features, you will need to update it to the latest
version as well.
