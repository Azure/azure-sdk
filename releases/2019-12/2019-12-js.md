- new preview for Event Hubs and Keyvault Certificates
- new library for Storage File Shares

## Feedback

## Changelog
Detailed change logs are linked to in the Quick Links below. Here are some critical call outs.

### App Configuration.

The latest preview of the `@azure/app-configuration` package now supports credential objects from the `azure/identity` package.

### Storage

The `@azure/storage-file-share` package has moved from preview to stable stage.
Please note that this package replaces the previous `@azure/storage-file` package.

### Event Hubs

The latest preview for the `@azure/event-hubs` package has built on top of the previous preview with slight API improvements
across the board. 
- To send events to a particular partition, the partition id is to be passed to the `createBatch` method instead of `sendBatch`.
- The interfaces used by the checkpoint store have been updated to remove overlap between `PartitionOwnership` and `Checkpoint`.
Therefore, if you have been using the `@azure/eventhubs-checkpointstore-blob` package to take advantage
of the load balancing and checkpointing features, you will need to update it to the latest version as well.
- Checkpoint store is now meant to be passed to the constructor of the `EventHubConsumerClient` class rather than the
`subscribe()` method on it.
