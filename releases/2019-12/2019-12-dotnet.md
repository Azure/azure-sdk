## Feedback

If you have a bug or feature request for one of the libraries, please [file an issue in our repo](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/issues/new/choose).

## Changelog

Detailed changelogs are linked from the [Quick Links](#quick-links) below. Here are some of the highlights:

### Storage

- Added check to enforce TokenCredential is used only over HTTPS
- Support using SAS token from connection string
- Update return types of `ForceCloseAllHandles`/`ForceCloseHandle` to be `CloseHandlesResult` and `Response<CloseHandlesResult>`, respectively, in Files.Shares
- DataLake Preview 7

### Event Hubs

- A large portion of the public API surface, including members and parameters, have had adjustments to their naming and organization in order to improve discoverability, provide better context to developers, and better conform to the [Azure SDK Design Guidelines for .NET]({{site.baseurl}}{% link docs/dotnet/introduction.md %}). For more details, please see the [Event Hubs](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/Azure.Messaging.EventHubs_5.0.0-preview.6/sdk/eventhub/Azure.Messaging.EventHubs/CHANGELOG.md#500-preview6) and [Event Processor](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/Azure.Messaging.EventHubs.Processor_5.0.0-preview.6/sdk/eventhub/Azure.Messaging.EventHubs.Processor/CHANGELOG.md#500-preview6) changelogs.

- The `EventProcessorClient` has been moved into its own [package](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/Azure.Messaging.EventHubs.Processor_5.0.0-preview.6/sdk/eventhub/Azure.Messaging.EventHubs.Processor) and evolved into an opinionated implementation on top of Azure Storage Blobs. This is intended to offer a more streamlined developer experience for the majority of scenarios and allow developers to more easily take advantage of the processor.

- A bug with the use of Azure.Identity credential scopes has been fixed; Azure identities should now allow for proper authorization with Event Hubs resources.

- The `EventHubsConsumerClient` and `EventHubProducerClient` types are no longer bound to a partition; the partition and other attibutes may now be requested at the operation-level to allow for more granular control over behavior without the need to create multiple clients.

- Events may now be read across all partitions of an Event Hub using the `ReadEvents` method of the consumer client. This is intened for exploring Event Hubs and not recommended for production use; for production scenarios, please consider using the `EventProcessorClient` as a more robust alternative.

- The API for the `EventProcessorClient` has been revised, adopting an event-driven model that aligns to many of the .NET base class library types and reduces complexity when constructing the client.
