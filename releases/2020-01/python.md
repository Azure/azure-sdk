## Changelog

Detailed change logs are linked to in the Quick Links below. Here are some critical call outs.

### App Configuration

- Add AAD auth support

### Event Hubs

- Added support for tracing ([issue #7153](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues/7153)).
- Added new boolean type parameter `track_last_enqueued_event_properties` in method `EventHubClient.create_consumer()`.
- Added new property `last_enqueued_event_properties` of EventHubConsumer which contains `sequence_number`, `offset`, `enqueued_time` and `retrieval_time information`.
- Removed support for IoT Hub direct connection. EventHubs compatible connection string of an IotHub can be used to create EventHubClient and read properties or events from an IoT Hub.
- Removed support for sending EventData to IoT Hub.
- Removed parameter exception in method `close()` of EventHubConsumer and EventHubProcuer.

### Storage

- The first preview for azure-storage-file-datalake has been released to allow accessing Azure Storage data with DataLake semantics when hierarchical namespace is enabled
- `azure.storage.file` is now `azure.storage.fileshare`.
  - The package is renamed from `azure-storage-file` to `azure-storage-file-share` along with renamed client modules.
- New API for stream download responses for blobs and files. This object is no longer iterable.
- Client and model modules are now internal.
- Changed optional params to keyword only in queues and files.
- `enqueue_message` is now called `send_message` in queues.
- Other breaking changes like renaming `LeaseClient` in blobs to `BlobLeaseClient`.

### Key Vault (Keys, Secrets, and Certificates)

- GA release of certificates

### Identity

- An async credential's transport session can be closed by using the credential as an async context manager (`async with`) or calling its `close` method

### Text Analytics

- The first preview with new API design for the azure-ai-textanalytics client library
- New APIs include `recognize_linked_entities` and `recognize_pii_entities`, and an improved version of `analyze_sentiment`
- New underlying REST pipeline implementation based on the `azure-core` library
- Authentication with subscription key or Azure Active Directory supported
- Module-level, single text operations provided for performing analysis on a single string
- Asynchronous API operations added under `azure.ai.textanalytics.aio`
- New input types allow user to provide a list of strings as the input documents 
- Responses now consist of a heterogeneous list of results and document errors returned in the order of the provided documents
- Keyword argument `model_version` can be used to specify the model version used to analyze documents
- Keyword arguments `default_country_hint` and `default_language` allow users to specify the defaults at client instantiation
