## Installation Instructions

To install the latest GA and beta libraries, we recommend you use the [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/). As an alternative, you may also integrate the libraries using [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/).

### Xcode

To add the Azure SDK for iOS to your application, follow the instructions in [Adding Package Dependencies to Your App](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding_package_dependencies_to_your_app):

With your project open in Xcode 11 or later, select **File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency...** Enter the clone URL of this repository: *https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-ios.git* and click **Next**. For the version rule, specify the exact version or version range you wish to use with your application and click **Next**. Finally, place a checkmark next to each client library you wish to use with your application, ensure your application target is selected in the **Add to target** dropdown, and click **Finish**.

### Swift CLI

To add the Azure SDK for iOS to your application, follow the example in [Importing Dependencies](https://swift.org/package-manager/#importing-dependencies):

Open your project's `Package.swift` file and add a new package dependency to your project's `dependencies` section, specifying the clone URL of the repository and the version specifier you wish to use:

```swift
// Insert dependencies here
```

Next, add each client library you wish to use in a target to the target's array of `dependencies`:

```swift
// Insert dependencies here
```

### Cocoapods

[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) is a dependency manager for Objective-C and Swift projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ [sudo] gem install cocoapods
```

> CocoaPods 1.5+ is required.

To integrate one or more client libraries into your project using CocoaPods, specify them in your [Podfile](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/the-podfile.html), providing the version specifier you wish to use. To ensure compatibility when using multiple client libraries in the same project, use the same version specifier for all Azure SDK client libraries within the project:

```ruby
// Insert dependencies here
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

## Feedback

If you have a bug or feature request for one of the libraries, please post an issue to [GitHub](https://github.com/azure/azure-sdk-for-ios/issues).
