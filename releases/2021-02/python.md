## Release highlights

### Event Hubs [Changelog](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/azure-eventhub_5.3.0/sdk/eventhub/azure-eventhub/CHANGELOG.md#530-2021-02-08)

- Added a `parse_connection_string` method which parses a connection string into a properties bag, `EventHubConnectionStringProperties`, containing its component parts.
- The constructor and `from_connection_string` method of `EventHubConsumerClient` and `EventHubProducerClient` now accept two new optional arguments:
  - `custom_endpoint_address` which allows for specifying a custom endpoint to use when communicating with the Event Hubs service,
and is useful when your network does not allow communicating to the standard Event Hubs endpoint.
  - `connection_verify` which allows for specifying the path to the custom CA_BUNDLE file of the SSL certificate which is used to authenticate
the identity of the connection endpoint.
- Updated uAMQP dependency to 1.2.14.
