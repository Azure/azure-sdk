- Collection properties are not settable anymore.
- `Create` and `Add` methods won't return the ID of the created entity anymore. A full object will be returned instead.

### Text Analytics  [Changelog](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/master/sdk/textanalytics/Azure.AI.TextAnalytics/CHANGELOG.md#510-beta4-2021-02-10)

#### New Features

- Added property `Length` to `CategorizedEntity`, `SentenceSentiment`, `LinkedEntityMatch`, `AspectSentiment`, `OpinionSentiment`, and `PiiEntity`.
- `StringIndexType` has been added to all endpoints that expose the new properties `Offset` and `Length` to determine the encoding the service should use. It is added into the `TextAnalyticsRequestOptions` class and default for this SDK is `UTF-16`.
- `AnalyzeHealthcareEntitiesOperation` now exposes the properties `CreatedOn`, `ExpiresOn`, `LastModified`, and `Status`.
- `AnalyzeBatchActionsOperation ` now exposes the properties `CreatedOn`, `ExpiresOn`, `LastModified`, `Status`, `ActionsFailed`, `ActionsInProgress`,  `ActionsSucceeded`, `DisplayName` and `TotalActions`.

#### Breaking Changes

- Analyze healthcare was redesigned. It can be accessed now by calling the `StartHealthcareEntities` and `StartHealthcareEntitiesAsync` methods. All operations now support result pagination. Renames and structure overall changed. For more information, please see the changelog notes.
- Analyze operation batch was redesigned. It can be accessed now by calling the `StartAnalyzeBatchActions` and `StartAnalyzeBatchActionsAsync` methods. All operations now support result pagination. Renames and structure overall changed. For more information, please see the changelog notes.

### Event Hubs [Changelog](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/master/sdk/eventhub/Azure.Messaging.EventHubs/CHANGELOG.md)

#### New Features

- Connection strings can now be parsed into their key/value pairs using the `EventHubsConnectionStringProperties` class.
- The body of an event has been moved to the `EventData.EventBody` property and makes use of the new `BinaryData` type.  To preserve backwards compatibility, the existing `EventData.Body` property has been preserved with the current semantics.
- It is now possible to specify a custom endpoint to use for establishing the connection to the Event Hubs service in the `EventHubConnectionOptions` used by each of the clients.

#### Key Bug Fixes

- Upgraded the `Microsoft.Azure.Amqp` library to resolve crashes occurring in .NET 5.

- It is now possible to specify a custom endpoint to use for establishing the connection to the Event Hubs service in the `EventHubConnectionOptions` for the processor.
- Interactions with Blob Storage have been tuned for better performance and more efficient resource use.  This will also improve start-up time, especially when using the `Greedy` load balancing strategy.

#### Key Bug Fixes

- Upgraded the `Microsoft.Azure.Amqp` library to resolve crashes occurring in .NET 5.

- Renamed `SearchIndexingBufferedSenderOptions<T>.RetryDelay` to `SearchIndexingBufferedSenderOptions<T>.ThrottlingDelay`.
- Removed the helper method `SearchClient.CreateIndexingBufferedSender<T>()`. Instead, callers are expected to use the public constructor of `SearchIndexingBufferedSender<T>`.
