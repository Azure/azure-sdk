Our authentication library is being released with some minor changes and fixes to the existing authentication methods.

We're happy to announce an initial preview of a client library that supports the newly announced preview of the Azure Metrics Advisor service. This library has been designed based on the [Azure SDK Design Guidelines for TypeScript]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/typescript/introduction.md %}) to ensure consistency, idiomatic design, and excellent developer experience and productivity.
