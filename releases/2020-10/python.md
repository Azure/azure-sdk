## Changelog

Detailed changelogs are linked from the [Quick Links](#quick-links) below. Here are some of the highlights:

### Service Bus [Changelog](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/master/sdk/servicebus/azure-servicebus/CHANGELOG.md)

#### Breaking changes

* Passing any type other than `ReceiveMode` as parameter `receive_mode` now throws a `TypeError` instead of `AttributeError`.
* Administration Client calls now take only entity names, not `<Entity>Descriptions` as well to reduce ambiguity in which entity was being acted on. TypeError will now be thrown on improper parameter types (non-string).
* `AMQPMessage` (`Message.amqp_message`) properties are now read-only, changes of these properties would not be reflected in the underlying message.  This may be subject to change before GA.

### Search [Changelog](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/master/sdk/search/azure-search-documents/CHANGELOG.md)

#### New Features

- Added auto_flush_interval support for SearchIndexingBufferedSender

#### Breaking Changes

- Renamed SearchIndexDocumentBatchingClient to SearchIndexingBufferedSender
- Renamed SearchIndexDocumentBatchingClient.add_upload_actions to SearchIndexingBufferedSender.upload_documents
- Renamed SearchIndexDocumentBatchingClient.add_delete_actions to SearchIndexingBufferedSender.delete_documents
- Renamed SearchIndexDocumentBatchingClient.add_merge_actions to SearchIndexingBufferedSender.merge_documents
- Renamed SearchIndexDocumentBatchingClient.add_merge_or_upload_actions to SearchIndexingBufferedSender.merge_or_upload_documents
- Stopped supporting window kwargs for SearchIndexingBufferedSender
- Split kwarg hook into on_new, on_progress, on_error, on_remove for SearchIndexingBufferedSender

### Text Analytics [Changelog](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/master/sdk/textanalytics/azure-ai-textanalytics/CHANGELOG.md#510b2-2020-10-06)

#### Breaking changes

* Removed extra property `length` from relevant models. Originally, this property represented the length of the `text` property in those same models. To get the length of the text in these models, just call `len()` on the text property.
