## Changelog

Detailed changelogs are linked from the [Quick Links](#quick-links) below. Here are some of the highlights:

### Service Bus [Changelog](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/master/sdk/servicebus/azure-servicebus/CHANGELOG.md)

#### Breaking changes

* Passing any type other than `ReceiveMode` as parameter `receive_mode` now throws a `TypeError` instead of `AttributeError`.
* Administration Client calls now take only entity names, not `<Entity>Descriptions` as well to reduce ambiguity in which entity was being acted on. TypeError will now be thrown on improper parameter types (non-string).
* `AMQPMessage` (`Message.amqp_message`) properties are now read-only, changes of these properties would not be reflected in the underlying message.  This may be subject to change before GA.

### Search [Changelog](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/master/sdk/search/azure-search-documents/CHANGELOG.md)

#### New Features

- Added auto_flush_interval support for SearchIndexingBufferedSender

#### Breaking Changes

- Renamed SearchIndexDocumentBatchingClient to SearchIndexingBufferedSender
- Renamed SearchIndexDocumentBatchingClient.add_upload_actions to SearchIndexingBufferedSender.upload_documents
- Renamed SearchIndexDocumentBatchingClient.add_delete_actions to SearchIndexingBufferedSender.delete_documents
- Renamed SearchIndexDocumentBatchingClient.add_merge_actions to SearchIndexingBufferedSender.merge_documents
- Renamed SearchIndexDocumentBatchingClient.add_merge_or_upload_actions to SearchIndexingBufferedSender.merge_or_upload_documents
- Stopped supporting window kwargs for SearchIndexingBufferedSender
- Split kwarg hook into on_new, on_progress, on_error, on_remove for SearchIndexingBufferedSender

### Text Analytics [Changelog](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/master/sdk/textanalytics/azure-ai-textanalytics/CHANGELOG.md#510b2-2020-10-06)

#### Breaking changes

* Removed extra property `length` from relevant models. Originally, this property represented the length of the `text` property in those same models. To get the length of the text in these models, just call `len()` on the text property.

### Identity [Changelog](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/master/sdk/identity/azure-identity/CHANGELOG.md#141-2020-10-07)

#### Key Bug Fixes

#### Administration [Changelog](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/master/sdk/keyvault/azure-keyvault-administration/CHANGELOG.md#400b2-2020-10-06)

#### New Features
- `KeyVaultBackupClient.get_backup_status` and `.get_restore_status` enable checking the status of a pending operation by its job ID

#### Breaking Changes
- The `role_assignment_name` parameter of `KeyVaultAccessControlClient.create_role_assignment` is now an optional keyword-only argument. The client will generate a name for the assignment when one isn't provided.

#### Keys [Changelog](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/master/sdk/keyvault/azure-keyvault-keys/CHANGELOG.md#430-2020-10-06)

- Added support for undeleting a container.
- Added support for `LastAccessTime` property on a blob, which could be the last time a blob was written or read.

#### File DataLake [Changelog](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/master/sdk/storage/azure-storage-file-datalake/CHANGELOG.md)

##### New Features
- Added support for recursive set/update/remove Access Control on a path and sub-paths.
- Added support for setting an expiry on files where the file gets deleted once it expires.

##### New Features

### Management Libraries
We are excited to announce the GA releases of management libraries that follow the [Azure SDK Design Guidelines for Python](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/python/guidelines/). These new libraries provide a number of core capabilities that are shared amongst all Azure SDKs, including the intuitive Azure Identity library, an HTTP Pipeline with custom policies, error-handling, distributed tracing, and much more. Documentation and code samples for these new libraries can be found [here](http://aka.ms/azsdk/python/mgmt)

More details of recent management library release annoucements as well as future roadmap can be found at [this blog post](https://aka.ms/azsdk/blog/octmgmtga)
