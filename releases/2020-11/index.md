## Release Highlights

### Identity

We're glad to announce a new major release of our Identity package. This release includes standardized Managed Identity Credential support across languages, through which we add support to Azure Arc and Azure Service Fabric. This release also includes improvements to Visual Studio Code Credential, Device Code Credential and Interactive Browser Credential.

### Service Bus

The new version 7 of the Service Bus libraries for C#, Python, Java, and JavaScript provide the ability to share in some of the cross-service improvements made to the Azure development experience, such as using the new Azure Identity library to share a single authentication between clients and a unified diagnostics pipeline offering a common view of the activities across each of the client libraries. These libraries come with a single top-level client for send and receive operations in contrast with multiple entry points from before, and a new administration client to perform CRUD operations on service bus entities. This version also includes many updates, improvements, and a great deal of restructuring when compared to the previous versions, refer to the migration guides to hop on to the latest versions.

### Form Recognizer

We're releasing a new beta version of Form Recognizer. This version includes support for two new prebuilt recognition models for invoices and business cards, support for selection marks as a new fundamental form element, support for the bitmap image format in prebuilt model recognition and content recognition, language and locale arguments added to process document in different languages, and other additional properties added to response models.
