The Azure SDK team is pleased to make available the November 2019 client library preview release. This represents the first release of the ground-up rewrite of the client libraries to ensure consistency, idiomatic design, and excellent developer experience and productivity. This preview release includes new client libraries for Azure Cosmos, Identity, Key Vault (certificates, keys and secrets), Event Hubs, and Storage (blob, file-shares and queues).

## Installation Instructions

To install the latest preview version of the packages, copy and paste the following commands into a terminal:

```bash
pip install --pre azure-cosmos
pip install --pre azure-eventhub
pip install --pre azure-eventhub-checkpointstoreblob-aio
pip install --pre azure-keyvault-certificates
pip install azure-keyvault-keys
pip install azure-keyvault-secrets
pip install azure-storage-blob
pip install --pre azure-storage-file-share
pip install azure-storage-queue
pip install --pre azure-appconfiguration
pip install azure-identity
```

## Feedback

## Changelog

Detailed change logs are linked to in the Quick Links below. Here are some critical call outs.

### Cosmos

- azure.cosmos.errors module deprecated and replaced by azure.cosmos.exceptions
- The access condition parameters (`access_condition`, `if_match`, `if_none_match`) have been deprecated in favor of separate `match_condition` and `etag` parameters.
- Added query Distinct, Offset and Limit support.

### Event Hubs

- Added support for tracing ([issue #7153](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues/7153)).
- Added new boolean type parameter `track_last_enqueued_event_properties` in method `EventHubClient.create_consumer()`.
- Added new property `last_enqueued_event_properties` of EventHubConsumer which contains `sequence_number`, `offset`, `enqueued_time` and `retrieval_time information`.
- Removed support for IoT Hub direct connection. EventHubs compatible connection string of an IotHub can be used to create EventHubClient and read properties or events from an IoT Hub.
- Removed support for sending EventData to IoT Hub.
- Removed parameter exception in method `close()` of EventHubConsumer and EventHubProcuer.

### Key Vault

- Restructured the `Certificate`, `Key`, and `Secret` models and renamed them to `KeyVaultCertificate`, `KeyVaultKey`, and `KeyVaultSecret`.
- Renamed methods to more clearly reflect their intended uses.
- Both async and sync versions of deleting and recovering keys and secrets now return pollers that can be awaited if necessary
- For more specific details about these changes, see the respective
[certificate](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/master/sdk/keyvault/azure-keyvault-certificates/HISTORY.md),
[key](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/master/sdk/keyvault/azure-keyvault-keys/HISTORY.md),
and [secret](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/master/sdk/keyvault/azure-keyvault-secrets/HISTORY.md) changelogs.

### Storage

- `azure.storage.file` is now `azure.storage.fileshare`.
  - The package is renamed from `azure-storage-file` to `azure-storage-file-share` along with renamed client modules.
- New API for stream download responses for blobs and files. This object is no longer iterable.
- Client and model modules are now internal.
- Changed optional params to keyword only in queues and files.
- `enqueue_message` is now called `send_message` in queues.
- Other breaking changes like renaming `LeaseClient` in blobs to `BlobLeaseClient`.

### App Configuration

-

### Identity
- `DefaultAzureCredential` accepts an `authority` keyword argument, enabling
its use in national clouds
- All credentials with `tenant_id` and `client_id` positional parameters now accept them in that order
- Optional parameters for several credentials are now keyword arguments
- Authenticating with a single sign-on shared with other Microsoft applications
only requires a username when multiple users have signed in
- Async credentials default to [aiohttp](https://pypi.org/project/aiohttp/)
for transport
- Known issue ([#8292](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/issues/8292)):
`DefaultAzureCredential` and `SharedTokenCredential` raise exceptions on Python 3.8
on Windows
