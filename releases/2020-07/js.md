## Changelog

Detailed changelogs are linked from the [Quick Links](#quick-links) below. Here are some of the highlights:

### Search

This is the first stable GA release of the Cognitive Search library.

#### Breaking Changes from Last Preview

- In Suggest API & Search API return values, a new property called `document` is introduced. All user-defined fields are moved inside this `document` property.
- In `analyzeText` API, the `text` parameter is moved from method level to inside `options` bag.
- In `search` API, `includeTotalResultCount` property is renamed to `includeTotalCount`.
- In `ServiceCounters`, the `skillsetCounter` property has been removed.
- Modified the names of several properties. Please refer [#9321](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/issues/9321) for a detailed list of renames.

### App Configuration

#### New Features

- Added browser support for the latest versions of Chrome, Edge and Firefox.

### Event Hubs

We have released two versions of the Event Hubs library this time. An update to the stable version with bug fixes, and a preview version with new features.

#### Key Bug Fixes

- The update to the stable version i.e version 5.2.2 has improved the application reliability when closing `EventHubConsumerClient` and `Subscriptions`.

#### New Features

- The preview version 5.3.0-preview.1 now supports configuring `loadBalancingOptions` when constructing the `EventHubConsumerClient` for more control over performance tuning while load balancing.

### Form Recognizer

#### New Features

- Added an `expiresOn` property to the `CopyAuthorization` type containing the time that the Copy Authorization will expire encoded as a JavaScript `Date` type.

#### Breaking Changes from Last Preview

- Replace `RecognizedReceiptArray` with the more generic `RecognizedFormArray` in the Poller response type returned by `beginRecognizeReceipts` and `beginRecognizeReceiptsFromUrl`.
- Rename the `textContent` field of the `FieldData` and `FormTableCell` types to `fieldElements` to mirror the change in its type.
- Rename the `FormField` type's `labelText` and `valueText` fields to `labelData` and `valueData` respectively, to mirror the change of their type to `FieldData`;
- Rename the `includeTextContent` request option to `includeFieldElements` to mirror the change to `FieldData` and `FormElement`.
- Rename `FieldText` to `FieldData` and `FormContent` to `FormElement` to reflect that fields may contain more than textual information.
- Rename `includeTextDetails` to `includeTextContent` in custom form and receipt recognition options to be consistent with other languages.
- Rename properties `requestedOn` to `trainingStartedOn` and `completedOn` to `trainingCompletedOn` in `CustomFormModel` and `CustomFormModelInfo` types.

### Service Bus

#### New Features

- Adds abortSignal support throughout Sender and non-session Receivers.
- (Receiver|SessionReceiver).subscribe() now returns a closeable object which will stop new messages from arriving but still leave the receiver open so they can be settled via methods like complete().
- `OperationOptions` has been added for the methods under `ServiceBusManagementClient`, this adds support for abortSignal, requestOptions when creating and sending HTTP requests.

#### Breaking Changes from Last Preview

- Standardized methods on senders and receivers to use the `Messages` suffix, removed dedicated methods dealing with a single message to reduce API surface.
- Standardized methods that peek and receive a given number of messages to use a similar signature.
  Old: `peekMessages(options);` and `receiveMessages(maxMessages, options);`
  New: `peekMessages(maxMessageCount, options);` and `receiveMessages(maxMessageCount, options);`
- Removed `isReceivingMessages` method on the `Receiver`.
- Management api updates

  - Renamed `createdOn`, `accessedOn` and `modifiedOn` properties to `createdAt`, `accessedAt` and `modifiedAt`, updated the corresponding type from `ISO-8601 timestamp string` to the `Date` type in the responses for the `runtimeInfo` methods for Queue, Topic and Subscription.
  - The property `top` in the options passed to any of the methods that get information for multiple entities like `getQueues` or `getQueuesRuntimeInfo` is renamed to `maxCount`.
  - The "update" methods (`updateQueue`, `updateTopic` and `updateSubscription`) now require all properties on the given queue/topic/subscription object to be set though only a subset of them are actually updatable. Therefore, the suggested flow is to use the "get" methods to get the queue/topic/subscription object, update as needed, and then pass it to the "update" methods.

#### Key Bug Fixes

- Fixed the bug where the messages scheduled in parallel with the `scheduleMessage` method have the same sequence number in response.
- Fixed the bug where the `userProperties` in a correlation filter are not populated in the rule while using the `ServiceBusManagementClient.createRule()` method.
