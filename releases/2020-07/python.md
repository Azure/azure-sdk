## Changelog

Detailed changelogs are linked from the [Quick Links](#quick-links) below. Here are some of the highlights:

### New Management Libraries

A new set of management libraries that follow the [Azure SDK Design Guidelines for Python](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/python/guidelines/) are now in Public Preview. These new libraries provide a number of core capabilities that are shared amongst all Azure SDKs, including the intuitive Azure Identity library, an HTTP Pipeline with custom policies, error-handling, distributed tracing, and much more. 
You can find the list of new packages [on this page](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/releases/latest/python.html). Documentation and code samples for these new libraries can be found [here](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk-for-python)

### Service Bus [Changelog](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/master/sdk/servicebus/azure-servicebus/CHANGELOG.md)

#### New Features

- This release continues to move towards feature parity with the existing sdk.  Recommend reading migration guide and full changelog for details.
- Support for management of Topic, Subscription and Rule entities; creation, deletion, and fetching of metadata.
- `receive_messages()` (formerly `receive()`) now supports receiving a batch of messages (`max_batch_size` > 1) without the need to set `prefetch` parameter during `ServiceBusReceiver` initialization.

#### Breaking changes

- `receive_messages()` (formerly `receive()`) no longer raises a `ValueError` if `max_batch_size` is less than the `prefetch` parameter set during `ServiceBusReceiver` initialization.
- To align better with broader service bus SDK family, renaming:
  `receive()` -> `receive_messages()`
  `peek()` ->  `peek_messages()`
  `schedule()` -> `schedule_messages()`
  `send()` ->  `send_messages()`
