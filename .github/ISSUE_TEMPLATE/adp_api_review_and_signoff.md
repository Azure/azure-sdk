# Attention
**For internal teams, our process for scheduling review sessions with the Azure SDK Architecture team has changed. The Azure SDK Architecture team has moved to using a [Scheduling Tool](https://aka.ms/azsdk/schedulesdkreview) for the scheduling of both Introduction and SDK Review meetings.**

Thank you for submitting this review request. Thorough review of your client library ensures that your APIs are consistent with the guidelines and the consumers of your client library have a consistently good experience when using Azure. 

**The Architecture Board reviews [Track 2 libraries](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/general_introduction.html) only.** If your library does not meet this requirement, please reach out to [Architecture Board](azsdkarch@microsoft.com) before creating the issue.

Please reference our [review process guidelines](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/policies_reviewprocess.html) to understand what is being asked for in the issue template.

To ensure consistency, all Tier-1 languages (C#, TypeScript, Java, Python) will generally be reviewed together.  In expansive libraries, we will pair dynamic languages (Python, TypeScript) together, and strongly typed languages (C#, Java) together in separate meetings.

For Tier-2 languages (C, C++, Go, Android, iOS), the review will be on an as-needed basis.

**Before submitting, ensure you adjust the title of the issue appropriately.**

**Note that the required material must be included before a meeting can be scheduled.**
