## Champion Scenarios

A champion scenario is a use case that the consumer of the client library is commonly expected to perform.  Examples might be "Update Firmware", "Download a file", "Recognize faces in a list of pictures".  Champion scenarios are used to ensure the developer experience is exemplary for the common cases.  You need to show the entire code sample (including error handling, as an example) for the champion scenarios.

* Champion Scenario 1:
    * Describe the champion scenario
    * Link to the code sample

_ Repeat for each champion scenario _
